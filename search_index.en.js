It was on the cusp of being called a city by the travelers arriving by boatloads each day, were it not for the inhabitants wielding their favorite pastry in a threatening way on even the slightest suggestion that their town was not just a little hamlet by the harbor. Once upon a time it was! And it was the way that many residents would like to keep it; a place separated from the world and the succession of time. But then the sunbathing sea serpents started dwelling on its shores, word spread of its many characters and possibilities, and so the world became aware of the quaint community by the Severely Sinister Sea: Beakerage!\n\nOn a sunny afternoon, Keith reclined on a beach towel. His coat unbuttoned to reveal his small frame as his fur absorbed the sun’s rays like a solar-powered calculator. Many knew him affectionately as the Quantum Quokka. Next to him was one of the sea serpents; Sylvie. Her scales shimmering in the sun in shades of red and purple. They would often find themselves sharing the sunspots and the occasional algebraic equation. Having just ended a lengthy discussion on the application of Schrödinger Equations for slowing down the time in Beakerage, Keith found himself in a sticky situation: his stomach had started growling. His emergency snack radar pinged - it was time for macarons!\nJumping up on his two feet, Keith quickly put his hand down his right pocket, the one designated for emergency but found only void - literal void!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        User generated image using SDXL1\n    \n\n\nArching a non-existing eyebrow, Sylvie gave a questioning glance. “The pocket-sized black hole, again?”\n“Curse you, entropy!” Keith muttered, shaking his tiny fist at the void. “Why must you devour my macarons?”\n“Entropy?” Sylvie questioned. “Are you sure it’s not just a hungry singularity?”\n“Same difference.” Keith sighed. “But it’s a conundrum I can’t seem to escape: I can’t put my emergency macarons in my left ‘just for safekeeping’ pocket - that would violate the principles of quantum coherence”\nSylvie blinked. “You don’t make much of a coherent sense right now!”\n“Quantum coherence,” Keith started. “You see, in our world, pockets exist in a delicate superposition. They’re simultaneously ‘emergency’ and ‘safekeeping.’ If I put an emergency item in my left pocket, it collapses the waveform, and suddenly it’s no longer safekeeping!”\n“That’s not how it is in our world. I think it’s only you. But you would need a third pocket?” Sylvie wondered.\nKeith jumped at the idea. “Exactly! I need a ‘Schroedinger’s Snack Stash’. It’ll exist in both states until observed. That way, my macarons won’t vanish.”\nOpening his pocket-sized black hole (carefully avoiding its event horizon), Keith coded an Elixir module: \ndefmodule QuantumPocket do\n  defstruct snacks: []\n  \n  def add_snack(pocket, snack) when is_list(snack) do\n    %{pocket | snacks: pocket.snacks ++ snack}\n  end\nend\n\nKeith summoned his freshly baked pocket and stored a little macaron crumb in it:\nkeiths_pockets = %QuantumPocket{}\nsafekeeping_pocket = QuantumPocket.add_snack(keiths_pockets, [\"Emergency Macarons (crumb)\"])\n\n“Are you sure that the little crumb is still there?” Sylvie inquired.\nKeith looked in the pocket to verify:\nIO.inspect(safekeeping_pocket.snacks)  # [\"Emergency Macarons (crumb)\"]\n\nWith a sigh of relief Keith looked over at Sylvie. “Yeah, it’s all good. Just wish it was the whole set, a crumb won’t carry me over until lunch.”\n“That’s the beauty of sunspot friends then. It’s not a probability flavored macaron, but have some of my milkshake that probably tastes of strawberry”.\nKeith grinned. “Looks like I’ve cracked the code, but you sure saved the afternoon”. And so, Keith, the Quantum Quokka, reclined once more. Sylvie nodded approvingly and followed suit. \nAnd thus, the legend of Schroedinger's Snack Stash was born - a tale of quantum pockets, sweet paradoxes, and the eternal struggle between hunger and coherence. \n","id":"https://abjork.land/articles/beakerage_chronicles/macaron-paradox/","title":"The Macaron Paradox"},"https://abjork.land/articles/beakerage_chronicles/schroedingers-snack-stash/":{"body":"\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Schroedinger's Snack Stash\n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n    \n        \n        Elixir\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the heart of Beakerage, where sea serpents sunbathed and pocket-sized black holes were as common as gossip at the local bakery, Keith - the Quantum Quokka - awoke with a start! “May your macarons never vanish into the void.” The ethereal voice was still echoing in Keith’s mind. He couldn’t recall anyone making such an astute statement, yet here it was: haunting him! His pocket-blackhole had been in a binging phase lately, often pulling each of his emergency snacks beyond the event horizon, leaving barely a crumb for sustenance.\n\nBeyond Beakerage - Elixir conundrums and learnings\n\nModule Definition\nAliasing modules\nStruct Definition\nStruct Manipulation\nPipelining\nElixir Documentation\nFunction Definition\nPrivate Function\nPattern Matching\nDateTime Manipulation\nString Interpolation\nEnum Mapping\nWriting tests\nTest for errors\n\n\nIt had been a conundrum, one which he thought he had solved with the help of his sunspot friend, Sylvie. Keith put on his slippers and waddled over to his desk while pondering. He always carried his pocket-blackhole in his ‘emergency’-pocket, and could not make use of his ‘safekeeping’-pocket for his snacks. That would violate the quantum coherence keeping his blackhole functional. But a third pocket would keep a snack in superposition in perpetuity, until observed! He had deftly solved it by adding a QuantumPocket, but feared that it was not as robust as he would like. These thoughts kept bugging his dreams.\nCarefully sorting away his notes on “the great disco ball multiverse theory” (this is a story for another time), he laid down a fresh sheet of paper and sat down. “No sleep tonight, but a solution to behold I hope”, Keith thought to himself as he leaned over the desk and grabbed a pair of safety goggles and put them on. His tiny hands started scribbling furiously. His quokka brain buzzed with ideas. He needed a pocket that defied both entropy and existential uncertainty: a pocket that would not collapse into a probability haze!\nAs the night turned to dawn, the first glimpses of a solution appeared on the horizon. Keith had his blueprint ready. He found that his pocket would need three components:\nStardust Silk, a robust and hardy material that would withstand quantum fluctuations by weaving memories together.\nTime-sprinkled Velcro, would stick to itself across parallel dimensions, fastening past with the future.\nUncertainty Thread, would surely leave snacks in a delightful superposition by threading memories within a bubble beyond space-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        A typical early day, Keith with sketches for a new invention or discovery [SDXL generation]\n    \n\n\nWhile many would need to cross the Severely Sinister Sea in search of moon spiders and pixieworms, Keith had all he needed in his right pocket: a blackhole with an Elixir interface!\nSetting out to construct the weave, Keith pulled out an otherworldly silk by his fingertips:\ndefmodule StardustSilk do\n  @doc \"\"\"\n  Weave the Stardust Silk, capturing cosmic memories\n  \"\"\"\n  def weave(memories) when is_list(memories) do\n    memories\n    |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;capture_memory/1)\n    |&gt; Enum.join\n  end\n\n  defp capture_memory(memory) do\n    \"🌟 #{memory} 🌟\"\n  end\nend\n\nTo make sure to keep the nightmares at bay, Keith realized he would need to construct tests for each module as well:\ndefmodule StardustSilkTest do\n  use ExUnit.Case\n\n  test \"weave memories into Stardust Silk\" do\n    memories = [\"Galaxy memories\", \"Comet sighs\", \"Black hole laughter\"]\n    expected_result = \"🌟 Galaxy memories 🌟🌟 Comet sighs 🌟🌟 Black hole laughter 🌟\"\n\n    assert StardustSilk.weave(memories) == expected_result\n  end\nend\n\nKeith threaded his tiny needle, its tip sharper than a quasar’s wit. The Stardust Silk shimmered, each strand holding a memory: the birth of a galaxy, the sigh of a comet, the laughter of a black hole. Keith’s quokka brain buzzed with anticipation. He was ready to weave eternity. Safe, knowing it would hold a cosmic weight worth of snacks - as long as it withstood the pressure and tearing of the space-time-continuum.\nLooking over his blueprint again; time-sprinkled velcro would hold the snack secure over past, present, and future - up until the time the bubble would be burst by Keith’s nimble fingers searching for a macaron. Knowing that the velcro will require a datetime, he deftly made use of pattern matching to structure the time-cohesive:\ndefmodule TimeSprinkledVelcro do\n  @doc \"\"\"\n  Attach the Velcro to moments, bridging past and future\n  \"\"\"\n  def attach(%DateTime{} = moment) do\n    past = DateTime.add(moment, -1, :day)\n    future = DateTime.add(moment, 1, :day)\n\n    \"🕰️ (from #{past} to #{future}) 🕰️\"\n  end\nend\n\nAnd the accompanying tests:\ndefmodule TimeSprinkledVelcroTest do\n  use ExUnit.Case\n\n  test \"attach Velcro to moments\" do\n    datetime = ~U[2023-12-26T07:51:11Z]\n    past = ~U[2023-12-25T07:51:11Z]\n    future = ~U[2023-12-27T07:51:11Z]\n\n    # Test the function with a specific moment\n    expected_result = \"🕰️ (from #{past} to #{future}) 🕰️\"\n\n    assert TimeSprinkledVelcro.attach(datetime) == expected_result\n  end\n\n  test \"raises an error for invalid input\" do\n    assert_raise FunctionClauseError, fn -&gt;\n      TimeSprinkledVelcro.attach(\"2023-12-26T07:51:11Z\")\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nHaving pulled both the stardust silk and the time-sprinkled velcro from the abyss, the Quantum Quokka contemplated how the uncertainty thread best would keep its characteristics once it was drawn from the blackhole as well. It all would come down to how the thread was observed! So letting something else do its magic with the thread would solve the dilemma: \ndefmodule UncertaintyThread do\n  alias StardustSilk, as: Silk\n  alias TimeSprinkledVelcro, as: Velcro\n\n  @doc \"\"\"\n  Thread each possible outcome together with rigorous uncertainty\n  \"\"\"\n  def thread(unknown, %Silk{} = silk_struct) when is_function(unknown, 1) do\n\n    memories_with_result =\n      Enum.map(silk_struct.memories, fn memory -&gt;\n        amount = unknown.(:rand.uniform(42))\n        \"#{memory} (#{amount})\"\n      end)\n\n    silk = Silk.weave(memories_with_result)\n    velcro = Velcro.attach(DateTime.utc_now)\n\n    %{silk: silk, velcro: velcro}\n  end\nend\n\nAnd testing for the expected behavior:\nExUnit.start()\n\ndefmodule UncertaintyThreadTest do\n  use ExUnit.Case\n\n  test \"threads memories and results\" do\n    silk_struct = %StardustSilk{memories: [\"Galaxy memories\", \"Comet sighs\"]}\n    result = UncertaintyThread.thread(fn _ -&gt; 42 end, silk_struct)\n\n    assert result.silk == \"🌟 Galaxy memories (42) 🌟🌟 Comet sighs (42) 🌟\"\n\n    expected_pattern = ~r/🕰️ \\(from \\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2} \\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}\\.\\d{6}Z to \\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2} \\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}\\.\\d{6}Z\\) 🕰️/\n    assert Regex.match?(expected_pattern, result.velcro)\n  end\nend\n\n\nStardustSilk and TimeSprinkledVelcro with UncertaintyThread weaves a handsomely new pocket under Keith’s nimble fingers. When he attached the new pocket to his coat he already felt a light tingle of anticipation. Schroedingers Snack Stash 2.0! While he could never be certain of the number of snacks he could retrieve, he now knew that the combination of the memories of the universe and the time spent in the past would fix some amount of snacks into the present. No longer was the dilemma whether there would be a snack or not, but whether there would be plenty or a few.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        Wonder of all wonders, a rain of macarons [SDXL generation]\n    \n\n\nAnd the Quantum Quokka reached into his pocket and found a fistful of probability-flavored macarons. A comet far-away sighed with relief, and on a beach much closer a sea serpent blessed the sun as it turned over to bathe in its rays. Who knew when a day would come when tampering with the space-time continuum would break Beakerage, but today was not that day. The Quantum Quokka looked at the fistful of macarons and thought to himself; “may you never vanish into the void”, and stuffed his mouth full of the delightful confections. \n\nBeyond Beakerage - check your Elixir knowledge\n\nHow do you define a module?\nWhy would you use a struct instead of a map?\nDid you see any use of pipelining?\nWould you prefer using pattern matching or a “when” guard for making sure a function gets the correct type of argument?\nHow can you test that an error will be thrown?\n\n\n","id":"https://abjork.land/articles/beakerage_chronicles/schroedingers-snack-stash/","title":"Schroedinger's Snack Stash"},"https://abjork.land/articles/eCommerce/":{"body":"Articles\nArticles about most anything: from software architecture and design to leisure items.\n","id":"https://abjork.land/articles/eCommerce/","title":"eCommerce"},"https://abjork.land/articles/eCommerce/stock-limit/":{"body":"\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Stock Limits?

Say no more! In this article, we’ll show you how to add a Stock Limit to your Sylius Storefront with ease. With Sylius’ flexibility and malleability, you can enhance your inventory in ways you never thought possible. And who knows? You might even have some fun along the way 😉. \n\n\n    Reading time: 13 minutes\n\nTable of content\n\nHow it starts\nStep 0\nBehold the new field - update the UI\nValidating Stock Limit\n\nHow it starts\nThe 'Track' button is Sylius’ trusty sidekick to keep your inventory in check with. With it you can ensure that you only sell what is in your stock.  \nSo what is it? It’s Sylius’ inventory feature! With this feature, you can set how many items are available for each product variant you have. By setting 'Track' on it, Sylius will add a validation check when a customer wants to add that item to their cart. This way, you will never sell more than what you have. But is it enough?\nSometimes, you just need a little extra something to feel like a true eCommerce master. Perhaps you don't want to sell all the items in stock, but keep some in store for later. Such a neat buffer-feature would be truly great to have. As this does not come out-of-the box for us, we will make it ourselves!\nTo reach our aim to feel like that eCommerce master we all strive to be, here is what we will do:\n\nCreate a StockLimitInterface\nImplement the interface on ProductVariant and add a stockLimit field\nUpdate the UI for setting the limit\nCreate an AvailabilityCheckerDecorator\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        I shop therefore I am. It’s like Descartes but with more bags.\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nBy the end of this article, you’ll be able to take advantage of our new, fresh-from-the-press, feature: individual stock limits for each product variant. With this feature, you’ll be able to set limits on how many of each product variant can be added to a cart. You’ll also be able to see when a product variant has less than the limit in stock. This new feature is perfect for businesses that want to manage their inventory more effectively and avoid overselling products. So let’s dive in and see how it all works!\nStep 0  \nIn this tutorial we will have PHP 8.1 and Sylius 1.12. If ever you need to compare your code, or rightfully snatch a whole lot of it, you can checkout the GitHub repository SomeLimitsShop:start (the start-branch has the initial setup).\nAdditional details:\n\nA docker-container for serving a MariaDB database. Remove all the configurations in the docker-compose.yml if you are starting from scratch and keep configuration for the database. See the GitHub repository for reference\nAs a development server we will use the Symfony development server. A good alternative is using the built-in PHP development server: php -S localhost -t /public\nWe will use Sylius default fixtures to load the database (php bin/console sylius:install will set it up for us)\n\nCreating potential with a StockLimitInterface\nOur starting point is defining the means for which we will check stock limits. Let’s get this in writing with a new interface, StockLimitInterface. We create this file at ./src/Inventory/StockLimitInterface:\n&lt;?php\n\n\nnamespace App\\Inventory;\n\n\ninterface StockLimitInterface\n{\n   public function getStockLimit(): int;\n}\n\nMake ProductVariant meatier\nWe enhance ProductVariant with the StockLimitInterface and add the accompanying field stockLimit. We will let it be nullable in the database but we will check its value before returning it in the getter. This way we will stay true to the interface and avoid any beef with our code.\n&lt;?php\n\n\ndeclare(strict_types=1);\n\n\nnamespace App\\Entity\\Product;\n\n\nuse App\\Inventory\\StockLimitInterface;\nuse Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping as ORM;\nuse Sylius\\Component\\Core\\Model\\ProductVariant as BaseProductVariant;\nuse Sylius\\Component\\Product\\Model\\ProductVariantTranslationInterface;\n\n\n/**\n* @ORM\\Entity\n* @ORM\\Table(name=\"sylius_product_variant\")\n*/\n#[ORM\\Entity]\n#[ORM\\Table(name: 'sylius_product_variant')]\nclass ProductVariant extends BaseProductVariant implements StockLimitInterface\n{\n   /**\n    * @ORM\\Column(type=\"integer\", nullable=true, options={\"default\" : 0})\n    */\n   private $stockLimit;\n\n\n   protected function createTranslation(): ProductVariantTranslationInterface\n   {\n       return new ProductVariantTranslation();\n   }\n\n\n   public function getStockLimit(): int\n   {\n       return $this-&gt;stockLimit ?? 0;\n   }\n\n\n   /**\n    * @param mixed $stockLimit\n    */\n   public function setStockLimit(?int $stockLimit): void\n   {\n       $this-&gt;stockLimit = $stockLimit;\n   }\n\n\n}\n\n\nWhenever we make a modification to an entity like this, we want to update the database schema accordingly. As Sylius is running with Doctrine, we have a couple of handy CLI commands at our disposal. Run these commands to update the database:\n\nphp bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff - to create a migrations-file with details for Doctrine on how to update the schema.\nphp bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate - to run the migration file.\n\nBehold the new field - update the UI\nIf we go to the Sylius Admin view and navigate to a product variant and its inventory-tab, we see that they may have a stock value, and per the default fixture it will not be set to be “tracked”. We will add a field to this view to set the Stock Limit. We will also add a field to the variants list-view so we can at a glance see if current stock is below the limit.  \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nWhile we are at the product variant view, let us update the Inventory to be tracked! Simply switch the slider and click “Save Changes”. When an inventory for a variant is tracked, we can see its current status in the product variants list. In the image below, we see that the first variant has 9 Available on hand. This field will also show the Stock Limit when we’re done here.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nWhat we will need:\n\nEnhance the form for ProductVariant to map the field stockLimit to a form field\nOverride the tab-template for inventory to add the form-field\nOverride the grid-template for inventory to show the stock-limit on variants-view\nAlso, we will add a translation field!\n\nEnhancing ProductVariant’s form type\nIt is a nice day when we don’t have to start from scratch. Since Sylius already has defined a Form type for ProductVariant, we will extend it through form type extensions! This will let us define just the field we have added to the ProductVariant and specify what type of form-field it should be. Let's create a new file at src/Form/ProductVariantTypeExtension.php\n&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1);\n\nnamespace App\\Form;\n\nuse Sylius\\Bundle\\ProductBundle\\Form\\Type\\ProductVariantType;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\AbstractTypeExtension;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\Extension\\Core\\Type\\IntegerType;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\FormBuilderInterface;\n\n\nclass ProductVariantTypeExtension extends AbstractTypeExtension\n{\n   public function __construct(\n   ){}\n   public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options): void\n   {\n       $builder-&gt;add('stockLimit', IntegerType::class, [\n           'label' =&gt; 'app.ui.stock_limit',\n           'required' =&gt; false,\n       ]);\n   }\n\n   public static function getExtendedTypes(): iterable\n   {\n       return [ProductVariantType::class];\n   }\n}\n\nThis declares that the stockLimit field should be an take integers as input. We also set its label to app.ui.stock_limit. This can be used when we want to add translations to it, but we could just have called it Stock Limit if we don't want to use the translation feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The only thing necessary for the triumph of bugs is for good developers to not specify data types\n\n    \n    \nOverride tab-template for inventory\nIf you ever want to update the Sylius admin view, there is a folder called ./templates/bundles/SyliusAdminBundle in your Sylius project. Here we can override any template or partial-template we like. As long as we mirror its original folder structure. For our case, we want to override the inventory template on a ProductVariant. It’s original template lies at this location: ./vendor/sylius/sylius/src/Sylius/Bundle/AdminBundle/Resources/views/ProductVariant/Tab/_inventoryContent.html.twig. It may be a bit mouthful, but that’s where it lies. Luckily, when we mirror the structure, we can just take anything after /views/ and replicate the structure to our project at ./templates/bundles/SyliusAdminBundle.  So we will copy the file _inventoryContent.html.twig and paste it to ./templates/bundles/SyliusAdminBundle/ProductVariant/Tab/. Then We will add the line {{ form_row(form.stockLimit) }} to our _inventoryContent.html.twig:\n&lt;h3 class=\"ui dividing header\"&gt;{{ 'sylius.ui.inventory'|trans }}&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"ui segment\"&gt;\n   {{ form_row(form.onHand) }}\n   {{ form_row(form.stockLimit) }}\n   {{ form_row(form.tracked) }}\n\n\n   &lt;div class=\"ui pointing above ignored label\"&gt;\n       {{ form_help(form.tracked) }}\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n   {{ form_row(form.version) }}\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n{{ sylius_template_event(['sylius.admin.product_variant.' ~ action ~ '.tab_inventory', 'sylius.admin.product_variant.tab_inventory'], {'form': form}) }}\n\nAnd Voila! We have just customized the admin view. Congrats! This will make it possible for us to set the Stock Limit. Let’s edit the same product variant as before, go to Inventory, and set Stock Limit to 10 (or whatever value is higher than current stock) and save the changes again.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\nNotice our label “app.ui.stock_limit”? It’s not yet time, but soon we will update it to something speakable.\n\nNext we will update the grid-view for product variants. In a similar fashion we find the template we want to override. Let’s create the file ./templates/bundles/SyliusAdminBundle/ProductVariant/Grid/Field/inventory.html.twig and add this content:\n{% if data.isTracked %}\n   &lt;div class=\"ui {{ (data.onHand - data.stockLimit) &gt; 0 ? 'green' : 'red' }} icon label\"&gt;\n       &lt;i class=\"cube icon\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n       &lt;span class=\"onHand\" data-product-variant-id=\"{{ data.id }}\"&gt;{{ data.onHand }}&lt;/span&gt; {{ 'sylius.ui.available_on_hand'|trans }}\n       {% if data.onHold &gt; 0 %}\n           &lt;div class=\"detail\"&gt;\n               &lt;span class=\"onHold\" data-product-variant-id=\"{{ data.id }}\"&gt;{{ data.onHold }}&lt;/span&gt; {{ 'sylius.ui.reserved'|trans }}\n           &lt;/div&gt;\n       {% endif %}\n       {% if data.stockLimit &gt; 0 %}\n           &lt;div class=\"detail\"&gt;\n               &lt;span class=\"onHold\" data-product-variant-id=\"{{ data.id }}\"&gt;{{ data.stockLimit }}&lt;/span&gt; {{ 'app.ui.stock_limit'|trans }}\n           &lt;/div&gt;\n       {% endif %}\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n{% else %}\n   &lt;span class=\"ui red label\"&gt;\n       &lt;i class=\"remove icon\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n       {{ 'sylius.ui.not_tracked'|trans }}\n   &lt;/span&gt;\n{% endif %}\n\nThe Sylius grid-system will pass in a data twig object to the form. In this case it will be an instance of a ProductVariant. So we can access its fields by using data.stockLimit. With this template we will change the color from green to red if a tracked inventory has less items on hand than the limit.\nThis will be the result:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nThis is just cosmetic still but we will add a validation for it later. But now to translation!\nAdd translation for app.ui.stock_limit\nAs a Symfony project, we will use the same translation system as we can find at other places in the Symfony-world. We will create a new file for English translations ./translations/messages.en.yaml and add the translation:\napp:\n   ui:\n       stock_limit: Stock Limit\n\n\nWe can reload the page and find that app.ui.stock_limit is replaced with Stock Limit!\n\nSometimes it is required to clear the cache with php bin/console cache:clear for translations to show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        One language sets you in a corridor for life. Two languages open every door along the way. Three languages make you a target for Vogon poetry.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nValidating Stock Limit\nAn item will appear as available for purchase as long as one item is available. And if a customer were to add multiple items to their cart, Sylius will first validate that it has that many items available before allowing the customer that purchase. In the example for “office grey jeans” we have 9 items in stock. So when adding 10 of these we get an error. But it will allow us to add 1. We want it to stop that as well, if it hits the Stock Limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nWhat we need is to enhance the default behaviour. We want to add a feature so it checks not only if the number of items in stock reaches 0, we want it to check if it reaches the Stock Limit. \nThere is a very good design pattern for this. It is called Decorator pattern. This allows us to use the already present class that handles the validation of stock and add new features to it. The service used for this is called sylius.availability_checker.default. It is alias for the class Sylius\\Component\\Inventory\\Checker\\AvailabilityChecker which uses an interface called Sylius\\Component\\Inventory\\Checker\\AvailabilityCheckerInterface. We will create a decorator for this, which will implement the AvailabilityCheckerInterface and take an instance of AvailabilityChecker in its constructor. This will let our decorator use the already present class when we want just the default behaviour, otherwise we will enhance it. Here is how.\nWe create a new file ./src/Inventory/AvailabilityCheckerDecorator.php with this content:\n&lt;?php\n\n\ndeclare(strict_types=1);\n\n\nnamespace App\\Inventory;\n\n\nuse Sylius\\Component\\Inventory\\Checker\\AvailabilityCheckerInterface;\nuse Sylius\\Component\\Inventory\\Model\\StockableInterface;\n\n\nclass AvailabilityCheckerDecorator implements AvailabilityCheckerInterface\n{\n   public function __construct(\n       private AvailabilityCheckerInterface $availabilityChecker\n   ){}\n\n\n   public function isStockAvailable(StockableInterface $stockable): bool\n   {\n       return $this-&gt;isStockSufficient($stockable, 1);\n   }\n\n\n   public function isStockSufficient(StockableInterface $stockable, int $quantity): bool\n   {\n       if ($stockable-&gt;isTracked() &amp;&amp; $stockable instanceof StockLimitInterface) {\n           $currentStock = $stockable-&gt;getOnHand() - $stockable-&gt;getOnHold();\n           $availableStock = $currentStock - $stockable-&gt;getStockLimit();\n\n\n           return $quantity &lt;= $availableStock;\n       }\n\n\n       return $this-&gt;availabilityChecker-&gt;isStockSufficient($stockable, $quantity);\n   }\n}\n\n\nWe see that we have two methods in this decorator. The first method is a simple availability check. It determines if at least 1 item is available. But instead of letting the default AvailabilityChecker handle it, we pass it to our second method; isStockSufficient. We add our logic to check that the Stock Limit is not surpassed if the item has implemented the StockLimitInterface. \nTo wire a decorator in a Symfony project (which Sylius is), is by defining it in our services.yaml and use an @.inner-argument, which will pass the decorated class to our decorator. Add the following decorator definition to ./config/services.yaml:\n App\\Inventory\\AvailabilityCheckerDecorator:\n     decorates: sylius.availability_checker.default\n     arguments:\n         - '@.inner'\n\n\nIf we now were to try to add 1 item of “office grey jeans” we will get the same message as when we tried to add 10! \nSylius may not have a Stock Limit feature built-in, but that’s okay. We can bend it, tweak it, and make it do what we want. That’s why we love Sylius. It’s not just an eCommerce platform, it’s an eCommerce playground. And we are having fun playing with it and becoming eCommerce masters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n  ","id":"https://abjork.land/articles/eCommerce/stock-limit/","title":"Stock Limits?

Its complex subject matter and documentation make it a challenge for newcomers.\nThe documentation for ggplot2 clearly explains this: \n\nIf you are new to ggplot2 you are better off starting with a systematic introduction, rather than trying to learn from reading individual documentation pages.\n\nBut what if learning about complex subjects could be easier? What if examples were always up-to-date and explanations plentiful? That's where the Elixir ecosystem shines! Imagine a world where package documentation is interactive, intuitive, and beginner-friendly - even when the subject matter is difficult.\nLet’s talk about documentation in Elixir-land!\nImagine if you’re visiting your common dependency registry, where you usually would search and find a package and some instructions for how to install it with your project, and of course a link to the package’s main webpage. In Elixir-land, this is where hexdocs.pm enters.\nhex is the ordinary Package Manager, but its documentation site is more than a place for installation instructions. Here you can find documentation for Elixir as well as every package available via hex. You would not need to leave hexdocs.pm for reading about more than installation instructions. It contains the API for each package, and in many cases the guides/tutorials for how to use them. And as everything with hexdocs.pm is managed on GitHub, anyone can be on top of any issues with documentation (such as rectifying poor explanations or adding or fixing examples) by issuing PRs.\nSome of these API documents also have guides connected to them; occasionally written in a format called livemd. These are markdown files that also works as live documents; meaning they are able to be launched with Livebook (either locally hosted or in cloud) and experimented with. This way, anyone can see how each function and struct can be used. \nWhat is Livebook\nLivebook is a format for interactive Elixir notebooks. Like Jupyter, but specialized for Elixir (and Erlang). They are run as web applications. And when you have a Livebook application, you may open any livemd-document in it. You will see a \"Run in Livebook\" button on these pages. \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nClicking it will open a new page where you can enter a URL to your local or cloud hosted Livebook application. You may also configure hexdocs.pm so it remembers your URL. \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \nHosting Livebook on Hugging Face\nHugging Face offers many alternatives for hosting. All it requires is that you've registered an account. Then you can onboard to their free hosting alternative. I'm registered as beercan, and let's see how onboarding would look like for me. \n\n\nCreate a new Space: Fill in the basic information for the Hugging Face Space.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nSelect the Space SDK: Possibilities are endless, as Hugging Face offers a Docker hosting alternative. Select Docker and the Livebook template.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nSelect hardware: We will run a basic setup, which offers 2 virtual CPUs with 16GB RAM. Other, priced, alternatives exists. For most cases, vCPUs are enough. If you want to be training your own models or use LLMs, then the need for the GPU alternatives are there for your choosing. You may also upgrade/downgrade at any point. \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nSecrets: Select a password for your Livebook application, and then let XLA_TARGET be cpu. (This should reflect the type of hardware that you are running your application on.)\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nMake your Livebook Private or Public: Select whatever you are comfortable with. Start with Private if you don't plan to make it visible to anyone.\n\n\nClick on Create Space. This will build the docker image and spin it up. Per default, the container will sleep after 48 hours of inactivity. Any of the paid alternatives allows to change this. \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nWhen the image is done building, it will be run, and you will be able to see this screen: \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nClicking on \"Dashboard\" will lead you to an authentication page where you will enter the password that you set earlier. Once that is passed, you can start to explore what Livebook is. It has multiple livebook documents teaching the basics of Elixir, Livebook, and some common Livebook components.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nExplore a Livebook document - Bumblebee\nLet's head to hexdocs.pm/bumblebee/examples.html#image-classification. Click the cog-icon in the upper right corner to access the settings and check \"Run in Livebook\". Paste your Livebook URL in the field. It should be something like https://beercan-liveboook.hf.space/, which is https://{username}-{projectName}.hf.space. \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nNow when we click on \"Run in Livebook\" it will initiate a new Livebook document for us in our Huggning Face space. Now we can configure and execute (or evaluate) each Elixir code element in our document. The first Elixir element is where we will install all the dependencies that will be covered in the document. It can be executed by hovering the element and click the Evaluate button that will appear.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nClicking it will start the code execution. Each element will have access to variables declared in earlier elexir elements, so you may define variables that will be used later in the code. \nWith Livebook we have access to a library of Livebook components in the form of the Kino dependency. In this example we will see how it renders an Image input-field:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nAnd to wrap this gift that is the Bumblebee library in Livebook, let's run an inference model on the image that was imported and see how it classifies the badger laying on the ground.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nIn this case, the model that was used was pretty sure that it indeed was a badger, with a .3% uncertainty about it. \nIn closing\nRemember how easy it was to set up a Livebook environment on Hugging Face? And how the interactive examples in Bumblebee's  documentation made understanding the library a breeze? This is just a taste of how Elixir and Livebook can streamline your learning of complex topics. Whether you're an Elixir beginner or a seasoned developer, there's always something new and exciting to discover. Go forth and explore – you might be surprised by the creative possibilities that await! \n","id":"https://abjork.land/articles/elixir/interactive-documents-with-livebook/","title":"Interactive documents with Livebook"},"https://abjork.land/articles/elixir/intro-to-genetic-algorithms-with-elixir/":{"body":"\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Intro to Genetic Algorithms with Elixir\n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n    \n        \n        elixir\n        \n        livebook\n        \n        algorithms\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    Written by Anders Björkland, Web Developer at Umain\n\nGenetic Algorithms (GA) are algorithms inspired by the evolutionary process found in nature. Sometimes these are called Stochastic Algorithms as they make use of randomness to find an optimal solution, but with features such a \"natural selection\" to remove less suitable solutions while generating new possible ones. \nGenetic Algorithms are found in route optimzation problems, in engineering (e.g. evolved antennas), in epidemic mitigation, and much more. \nIn this article we will solve a simple problem: \"what is the target phrase?\". This is not a real-world problem, but suitable enough to showcase each component of a Genetic Algorithm; like a \"Hello World\" of Genetic Algorithms. With the foundation provided by this, I hope this can give you a better understanding of GAs, and an appreciation for using Elixir with them.\nAnatomy of a Genetic Algorithm\nA genetic algorithm will try to promote the possible soultions (chromosomes) with the best \"fitness\" and combine them into a new possible solution, which will inherit features of both. While it does this, it may introduce some mutations (small changes that were not part of its \"parents\" chromosomes). \nIn essence, these are the genetic algorithm's components:\n\nChromosomes\npossible solutions\nInitial population\nrandom chromosomes\nFitness evaluation\nSelection\nbetter fitness score are more likely to be chosen as \"parents\"\nCrossover\n\"mating\" of parents to produce an \"offspring\", a new chromosome\nMutation\nsmall random changes in a chromosome\nEvolution Loop\nrepeating the steps of selection -&gt; crossover -&gt; mutation to arrive at a chromosome that is the best fit for the problem at the hand\n\nWe will add an \"elitism\" component to this which will make sure that the best possible solutions are never discarded. This is a component that may act dynamic depending on where we are in the evolution loop. But initially we will keep it static. \n\nFor anyone who has set up a Livebook application and want to experiment, just grab the source from my gist (copy) and click Open/From source. \nIf you haven't set up a Livebook application, read about how to do that in my article Interactive documents with Livebook. You can set it up on free hosting via Hugging Face. \n\nThe target phrase\nOur goal is via random chromosomes start selecting the best fit ones to crossover with each other. They will be selected based on how well they fit with the target phrase. It will be a phrase based on characters from 'a' to 'z', with space included. Let's define this:\ndefmodule GeneticString do\n  # We define the target phrase here but it might as well be passed in via the evolve function.\n  @target_phrase \"The solution is yet to emerge\"\n\n  # Defines which characters can be present in the target phrase\n  defp possible_characters() do\n    Enum.to_list(?a..?z) ++\n      Enum.to_list(?A..?Z) ++\n      [?_, ?\\s]\n  end\n\nend\n\nThe first chromosome\nThe first step towards arriving at a solution is a function to generate a random chromosome. It will produce a chromosome of length length by random characters present in possible_characters. This function will be used to generate the initial population.\ndefmodule GeneticString do\n  # ...\n\n  # Generate a random chromosome (potential solution)\n  defp random_chromosome() do\n    Enum.map(\n      1..String.length(@target_phrase),  # We will help the GA along the way by letting it set correct length\n      fn _ -&gt; possible_characters() |&gt; Enum.random() end\n    )\n    |&gt; List.to_string()\n  end\n\nend\n\nEvaluating fitness\nThe fitness evaluation is an important part in the genetic algorithm. It will tell the algorithm when it is moving closer towards a solution. In our case, we will do a fairly simple evalutaion. The fitness score will represent how many characters are correctly placed in the chromosome when compared to target_phrase. A more evolved fitness evaluation might take into account its length as well as maybe its Levenshtein distance, and so on. \nWe will see that our fitness evaluation will also take a map, a \"memo\" of already evaluated chromosomes. This way an already evaluated chromosome will not have to be calculated again. This would be a trade-off between memory/retrieval and calculation cycles.\ndefmodule GeneticString do\n  # ...\n\n  # Calculate fitness based on if a character is placed in the correct n:th place.\n  defp fitness_calc(chromosome) do\n    chromosome\n    |&gt; String.graphemes()\n    |&gt; Enum.zip(String.graphemes(@target_phrase))\n    |&gt; Enum.count(fn {char1, char2} -&gt; char1 == char2 end)\n  end\n\n  # Either retrieve fitness score for a chromosome or calculate it and place it in the map\n  defp fitness(chromosome, memo \\\\ %{}) do\n    case Map.get(memo, chromosome) do\n      nil -&gt;\n        fitness = fitness_calc(chromosome)\n        updated_memo = Map.put(memo, chromosome, fitness)\n        {fitness, updated_memo}\n\n      fitness -&gt;\n        {fitness, memo}\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Updates the fitness map for all chromosomes\n  defp memoize_fitness([], memo), do: memo\n  defp memoize_fitness([chromosome | tail], memo) do\n    {_, new_memo} = fitness(chromosome, memo)\n    memoize_fitness(tail, new_memo)\n  end\n\nend\n\nParents, offsprings and mutations\nWe have now defined fitness and chromosomes. Let's go to the next part, which is selecting parents to produce offsprings via the components crossover and mutation. The idea is to get at least one parent from the ones with the best fitness score, and the other parent from the broader population. Once selected, these will be passed to the crossover function to produce the offspring, and a mutation function that will introduce a bit of variation. Currently we will only make a mutation in one randomly chosen spot.\ndefmodule GeneticString do\n  # ...\n\n  # Randomly select two \"parents\" from the provided list of chromosomes\n  defp select_parents([]), do: []\n  defp select_parents(possible_parents) do\n    possible_parents\n    |&gt; Enum.shuffle()\n    |&gt; Enum.take(2)\n  end\n\n  # Combine first part of one chromosome to the second part of another. \n  # The resulting chromosome will have features from both \"parents\"\n  defp crossover(chromosome1, chromosome2) do\n    crossover_point = Enum.random(1..(String.length(chromosome1) - 1))\n\n    String.slice(chromosome1, 0, crossover_point) &lt;&gt;\n      String.slice(chromosome2, crossover_point, String.length(chromosome2) - crossover_point)\n  end\n\n  # Introduce a random mutation to a chromsome. \n  # The spot where the mutation will happen is randomly chosen, as is the possible character introduced.\n  defp mutation(chromosome) do\n    mutation_point = Enum.random(0..(String.length(chromosome) - 1))\n\n    String.slice(chromosome, 0, mutation_point) &lt;&gt;\n      List.to_string([possible_characters() |&gt; Enum.random()]) &lt;&gt;\n      String.slice(\n        chromosome,\n        mutation_point + 1,\n        String.length(chromosome) - (mutation_point + 1)\n      )\n  end\n\n\nEvolution - the iterative process to produce best fit chromosome\nWe will be using a evolve mechanism where we will initialize a starter population with a radom chromosomes and set an elitism rate. These initial values will be passed into a recursive evolve mechanism (our evolution loop). Once we've either gotten a perfect fitness score, or we have hit the generation limit, we will return the best suited chromosome. \n(While we are at it we will also bundle in which iteration - n:th generation - we were at when the chromosome was produced.)\ndefmodule GeneticString do\n  # ...\n\n  # Recursive function that will continue evolving the chromosomes until a perfect fitness score is reached, \n  # or the generation limit has been reached.\n  defp evolve_mechanism(generation, %{population: [best_match | _]}, _elitism, _fitness_memo)\n      when generation.limit == generation.i,\n      do: %{chromosome: best_match, generation: generation.i}\n\n  defp evolve_mechanism(generation, population_data, elitism, fitness_memo) do\n    memoized_fitness = memoize_fitness(population_data.population, fitness_memo)\n\n    # Sort population based on fitness\n    sorted_population =\n      population_data.population\n      |&gt; Enum.sort_by(fn chromosome -&gt; Map.get(memoized_fitness, chromosome) end, :desc)\n\n    # Select number of population that will have a higher chance to survive, and produce offspring\n    elite_population =\n      sorted_population\n      |&gt; Enum.take(elitism.count)\n\n    rest_population = Enum.drop(sorted_population, elitism.count) |&gt; Enum.shuffle()\n\n    possible_parents = case length(elite_population) do\n      x when x &lt; 2 -&gt; elite_population ++ Enum.take(sorted_population, 2)\n      _ -&gt; elite_population\n    end\n    [parent1, parent2] = select_parents(possible_parents)\n\n    # Produce offspring by combining parents and introduce a mutation\n    offspring = crossover(parent1, parent2) |&gt; mutation()\n\n    # Keep an elite-num of chromosome, and drop less fortunate chromomse before appending the offspring\n    new_population =\n      (elite_population ++ rest_population)\n      |&gt; Enum.drop(-1)\n      |&gt; Kernel.++([offspring])\n\n    [elite | _] = new_population\n    fitness_score = Map.get(memoized_fitness, elite)\n    max_score = String.length(@target_phrase)\n\n    # If perfect fitness score, then return the elite chromosome.\n    case fitness_score do\n      x when x == max_score -&gt;\n        %{chromosome: elite, generation: generation.i}\n\n      _ -&gt;\n        evolve_mechanism(\n          %{i: generation.i + 1, limit: generation.limit},\n          %{population: new_population, size: population_data.size},\n          elitism,  # Might be switched for adaptive elitism\n          memoized_fitness\n        )\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nThe evolve_mechanism function is recursive in that it will call itself as long as we either haven't gotten a perfect fitness or we have hit a generation limit.\nNow it's finally time to define our entry-point to this genetic algorithm. evolve will set up some initial values and start the evolve-mechanism:\ndefmodule GeneticString do\n  # ...\n\n  #  Our ENTRY POINT to the evolution\n  def evolve(population_size, generation_limit \\\\ 100) do\n    population = Enum.map(1..population_size, fn _ -&gt; random_chromosome() end)\n    elitism_rate = 0.01\n\n    evolve_mechanism(\n      %{i: 0, limit: generation_limit}, # generation data\n      %{population: population, size: population_size}, # population data\n      %{rate: elitism_rate, count: floor(elitism_rate * population_size)}, # elitism data (suitable for adding an adaptive mechanism)\n      %{} # fitness map\n    )\n  end\nend\n\nWe can call our Genetic Algorithm with the following command: GeneticString.evolve(50, 20000). This will set the initial population to 50 and sets the generation limit to 20000. The result will be a map like this: %{generation: 6367, chromosome: \"The solution is yet to emerge\"}\nOur Genetic Algorithm has multiple points where we can experiment with its different parameters. Instead of a static elitism_rate we can involve a more dynamic or adaptive format. We can also experiment with number of offsprings and parents as well. There are a lot of ways to tweak just this simple Genetic Algorithm, but for now, let's explore how it would be like to have elitism that is adjusted according to how far along the generations has come towards the generational limit.\nFirst we will add a new function that will update the elitism:\ndefmodule GeneticString do\n  # ...\n\n  defp adjust_elitism(elitism, generation, population_size) do\n    progress = generation.i / generation.limit\n\n    rate = case progress do\n      # Less of population considered for elite (aka, in this case, available for reproduction)\n      x when x &lt; 0.2 -&gt;\n        max(elitism.rate - 0.05, 0.01)\n\n      # In later generations, a larger proportion of population will be included in elite population\n      _ -&gt; \n        min(elitism.rate + 0.01, 0.25)\n    end\n\n    %{rate: rate, count: floor(rate * population_size)}\n  end\nend\n\nThen we will update our evolution_mechanism so that in its recursive call will be updating the elitism:\ndefmodule GeneticString do\n  # ...\n\n  defp evolve_mechanism(generation, population_data, elitism, fitness_memo) do\n    # ...\n    case fitness_score do\n      x when x == max_score -&gt;\n        %{chromosome: elite, generation: generation.i}\n\n      _ -&gt;\n        evolve_mechanism(\n          %{i: generation.i + 1, limit: generation.limit},\n          %{population: new_population, size: population_data.size},\n          adjust_elitism(elitism, generation, population_data.size),  # We change this row to update elitism\n          memoized_fitness\n        )\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nI test ran our genetic algorithm first with a static elitism, then with an adjusted elitism. Each was run 1000-times. I plotted their density curves and gathered their core descriptive statistics. Let's see the result:\n\n\n    n:th generation (static elitism)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    minmaxmeanmedianstdev\n239120000717067632497\n\n\n\n\n\n    n:th generation (adjustable elitism)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    minmaxmeanmedianstdev\n214915078629759911847\n\n\n\nWith this adjustable elitism, we got a more narrow distribution and a lower median. We can argue that the inclusion of the adjustable elitism improved our algorithm. But still, there are so many ways we can tinker with it. The elitism can have multiple ways it can be adjusted; different cut-offs, rate changes, minimum and maximum rates, and so on. But there are also many other adjustments we can make. How many parents we will allow getting offsprings, and how many? Perhaps the fitness-evaluation is too simple and need more nuance? Should the crossover be more of a diffusion where one parent's feature is scattered in the chromosome? \nThe Genetic Algorithm is versatile! We have seen its core components and got to tinker with them. We have explored one way to make it more dynamic and what impact that may have. Even a simple GA as we have built here can be adjusted in many different ways. I therefor welcome you to do so. I have created a GitHub Gist with a Livebook document that you may use in your own Livebook session: genetic-algorithm.livemd\n","id":"https://abjork.land/articles/elixir/intro-to-genetic-algorithms-with-elixir/","title":"Intro to Genetic Algorithms with Elixir"},"https://abjork.land/articles/elixir/liveview-and-broadcast/":{"body":"\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Laugh Out Loud with LiveView\n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n    \n        \n        elixir\n        \n        phoenix\n        \n        liveview\n        \n        PubSub\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nAre you ready to take your website to the next level?

We create it by running the following commands in a terminal:\nmix phx.gen.json Jokes Joke jokes text:text likes:integer dislikes:integer\nmix ecto.migrate\nAnd add API-routes\nWe will use the API to add new Jokes for our application. This is also a repetition of earlier article, but as it is with repetition: it makes the love grow fonder. (Or is that distance?)\nWe will add the API-routes by adding the following to the module in ./lib/lean_jokers_web/router.ex:\n  scope \"/api\", LeanJokersWeb do\n    pipe_through :api\n\n    resources \"/jokes\", JokeController, except: [:new, :edit, :delete]\n  end\n\nAnd we will update the Joke-schema to default likes and dislikes to 0:\nIn ./lib/lean_jokers/jokes/joke.ex:\n  schema \"jokes\" do\n    field :dislikes, :integer, default: 0\n    field :likes, :integer, default: 0\n    field :text, :string\n\n    timestamps()\n  end\n\nWe are now ready to add a couple of classic bad-jokes (or absolutely-brilliant-jokes): \n\nWhy did the coffee file a police report? It got mugged.\nWhy don’t skeletons fight each other? They don’t have the guts.\nThere are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don’t.\nWhat do you call cheese that isn’t yours? Nacho cheese.\nWhy don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything. \n\nMake a POST-request for each joke to the endpoint http://localhost:4000/api/jokes with the following JSON payload:\n{\n    \"joke\": {\n        \"text\": \"Why did the coffee file a police report? It got mugged.\"\n    }\n}\n\nComing alive!\nOur next task is to show these jokes on our homepage. The recommended way to build with LiveView is to let all LiveView logic live in its own namespace under the web-paradigm. So lets add a live folder at ./lib/lean_jokers_web/ and create two new files in it: home.ex and home.html.heex. \nThe first file, home.ex, will contain our logic, while home.html.heex will contain our view. Let's just see if we can get it all to run.\n./lib/lean_jokers_web/home.ex:\ndefmodule LeanJokersWeb.Live.Home do\n  use LeanJokersWeb, :live_view\n\n  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do\n    {:ok, socket}\n  end\nend\n\n./lib/lean_jokers_web/home.html.heex:\n&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n./lib/lean_jokers_web/router.ex:\n  scope \"/\", LeanJokersWeb do\n    pipe_through :browser\n\n    live \"/\", Live.Home\n  end\n\nWhen we now go to localhost:4000 we should see a simple Hello World. If you do, we are ready to display some jokes. Head back to the home.ex file, and let's use an Ecto repository to get our jokes, and assign them to the socket.\n./lib/lean_jokers_web/home.ex: \ndefmodule LeanJokersWeb.Live.Home do\n  use LeanJokersWeb, :live_view\n\n  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do\n    jokes = LeanJokers.Jokes.Joke\n      |&gt; LeanJokers.Repo.all()\n\n    socket = socket\n      |&gt; assign(:jokes, jokes)\n\n    {:ok, socket}\n  end\nend\n\nOur next task is to access the jokes from the socket in our view.\n./lib/lean_jokers_web/home.html.heex: \n&lt;div class=\"flex flex-col gap-4\"&gt;\n&lt;%= for joke &lt;- @jokes do %&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= joke.text %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"flex gap-2\"&gt;\n            &lt;div&gt;Likes: &lt;%= joke.likes %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div&gt;Disikes: &lt;%= joke.dislikes %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nPhoenix comes packed with TailwindCSS, so we are using some of its utility classes to list our jokes with gap in between them by the power of flex and flex-gap. We are then looping through the jokes variable that we fetch from socket.assigns.jokes. We are using its shorthand @jokes to get it. After saving the file we will have all the jokes displayed on our website, along with their likes and dislikes.\nAdd interactivity\nOur Lean Jokes website is not very exciting at the moment, but it soon will be. We will be adding buttons to like or dislike a joke. By doing this we will update a joke and see it change in real-time! The difference between this and a simple incremented counter may not look like much, but all the changes occur on the server with updates to the database. Only the necessary data is exchanged between our frontend and backend. We will take a look at what happens in the network, but first we add the buttons to our view.\n./lib/lean_jokers_web/home.html.heex: \n&lt;div class=\"flex flex-col gap-4\"&gt;\n&lt;%= for joke &lt;- @jokes do %&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= joke.text %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"flex gap-2\"&gt;\n            &lt;div&gt;\n                &lt;button phx-click=\"like_joke\" phx-value-joke_id={joke.id}&gt;Like&lt;/button&gt; &lt;%= joke.likes %&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div&gt;\n                &lt;button phx-click=\"dislike_joke\" phx-value-joke_id={joke.id}&gt;Dislike&lt;/button&gt; &lt;%= joke.dislikes %&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nNext up, we will want to add event-handlers for these buttons. We should handle like_joke and dislike_joke. The passed joke.id will be used to update the correct joke. With the power of pattern-matching, we will get the variable joke_id from the parameters that are passed along with the event. This will help us with two things. First, it will help us update the correct joke in the database. Second, it will help us insert the updated joke in the jokes-list and pass it back in the socket. \n./lib/lean_jokers_web/home.ex: \n  def handle_event(\"like_joke\", %{\"joke_id\" =&gt; joke_id} = _params, socket) do\n\n    # Elixir cares about types, but the joke_id is a string here as it was a templated variable\n    {joke_id, _} = Integer.parse(joke_id)\n    \n    # Filter out the joke with the help of the id\n    socket_jokes = socket.assigns.jokes\n    [socket_joke | _rest ] = Enum.filter(socket_jokes, &amp;(&amp;1.id == joke_id))\n\n    # Increment the value and update the joke in the database\n    {:ok, joke} = LeanJokers.Jokes.update_joke(socket_joke, %{likes: socket_joke.likes + 1 })\n\n    # Replace the joke with our updated joke in the list \n    jokes =\n      socket.assigns.jokes\n        |&gt; Enum.map(fn\n          %LeanJokers.Jokes.Joke{id: ^joke_id} -&gt; joke\n          element -&gt; element\n        end)\n\n    # and add the list to the sockets assigns\n    socket = socket\n      |&gt; assign(:jokes, jokes)\n    {:noreply, socket}\n  end\n\n  def handle_event(\"dislike_joke\", %{\"joke_id\" =&gt; joke_id} = _params, socket) do\n    {joke_id, _} = Integer.parse(joke_id)\n    socket_jokes = socket.assigns.jokes\n    [socket_joke | _rest ] = Enum.filter(socket_jokes, &amp;(&amp;1.id == joke_id))\n\n    {:ok, joke} = LeanJokers.Jokes.update_joke(socket_joke, %{dislikes: socket_joke.dislikes + 1 })\n\n    jokes =\n      socket.assigns.jokes\n        |&gt; Enum.map(fn\n          %LeanJokers.Jokes.Joke{id: ^joke_id} -&gt; joke\n          element -&gt; element\n        end)\n\n    socket = socket\n      |&gt; assign(:jokes, jokes)\n    {:noreply, socket}\n  end\n\nBack in the browser we will see that we can now update each joke and see likes and dislikes being updated in real time. \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Your browser does not support this video\n\nLet's tighten this up so that a visitor can toggle their like or dislike, so no-more will they be able to like it 10 times over. We will also set so if a joke has been liked by the visitor, were they to change their mind to dislike, the like will be removed and a dislike added.\nWe will start by adding fields to the joker-struct to keep track of visitor's like or dislike of a joke. This will not be stored in a database as it will be unique for each visitor. So we will add a virtual field for this. \nlib/lean_jokers/jokes/joke.ex\n  schema \"jokes\" do\n    # ...\n    field :has_liked, :boolean, virtual: true, default: false\n    field :has_disliked, :boolean, virtual: true, default: false\n\n    # ...\n  end\n\nWith these fields we can add a toggle-logic for a joke's likes and dislikes. \nlib/lean_jokers_web/live/home.ex\ndef handle_event(\"like_joke\", %{\"joke_id\" =&gt; joke_id} = _params, socket) do\n    {joke_id, _} = Integer.parse(joke_id)\n\n    socket_jokes = socket.assigns.jokes\n    [socket_joke | _rest ] = Enum.filter(socket_jokes, &amp;(&amp;1.id == joke_id))\n\n    toggled_joke = toggle_data(socket_joke, :like)\n\n    {:ok, _} =\n      LeanJokers.Jokes.Joke\n        |&gt; LeanJokers.Repo.get(joke_id)\n        |&gt; LeanJokers.Jokes.update_joke(%{likes: toggled_joke.likes, dislikes: toggled_joke.dislikes})\n\n    jokes =\n      socket.assigns.jokes\n        |&gt; Enum.map(fn\n          %LeanJokers.Jokes.Joke{id: ^joke_id} -&gt; toggled_joke\n          element -&gt; element\n        end)\n\n    {:noreply, assign(socket, :jokes, jokes)}\n  end\n\n  def handle_event(\"dislike_joke\", %{\"joke_id\" =&gt; joke_id} = _params, socket) do\n    {joke_id, _} = Integer.parse(joke_id)\n\n    socket_jokes = socket.assigns.jokes\n    [socket_joke | _rest ] = Enum.filter(socket_jokes, &amp;(&amp;1.id == joke_id))\n\n    toggled_joke = toggle_data(socket_joke, :dislike)\n\n    {:ok, _} =\n      LeanJokers.Jokes.Joke\n        |&gt; LeanJokers.Repo.get(joke_id)\n        |&gt; LeanJokers.Jokes.update_joke(%{likes: toggled_joke.likes, dislikes: toggled_joke.dislikes})\n\n    jokes =\n      socket.assigns.jokes\n        |&gt; Enum.map(fn\n          %LeanJokers.Jokes.Joke{id: ^joke_id} -&gt; toggled_joke\n          element -&gt; element\n        end)\n\n    {:noreply, assign(socket, :jokes, jokes)}\n  end\n\n  defp toggle_data(%Jokes.Joke{} = joke, :like) do\n    dislikes = if (joke.has_disliked) do\n      joke.dislikes - 1\n    else\n      joke.dislikes\n    end\n\n    likes = if (joke.has_liked) do\n      joke.likes - 1\n    else\n      joke.likes + 1\n    end\n\n    joke = %{joke | has_liked: !joke.has_liked, likes: likes, dislikes: dislikes}\n\n    if (joke.has_liked) do\n        %{joke | has_disliked: false}\n    else\n      joke\n    end\n  end\n\n  defp toggle_data(%Jokes.Joke{} = joke, :dislike) do\n    dislikes = if (joke.has_disliked) do\n      joke.dislikes - 1\n    else\n      joke.dislikes + 1\n    end\n\n    likes = if (joke.has_liked) do\n      joke.likes - 1\n    else\n      joke.likes\n    end\n\n    joke = %{joke | has_disliked: !joke.has_disliked, likes: likes, dislikes: dislikes}\n\n    if (joke.has_disliked) do\n        %{joke | has_liked: false}\n    else\n      joke\n    end\n  end\n\nWhat is happening here? Well, we have toggled the data for jokes so that a user only can like or dislike a joke once. They will not be allowed to simultaneously like and dislike a joke. If a joke has been liked, disliking it will undo the like and increment the dislike one step.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    I wanted both?!\n    \n        \n    \nMake it broadcast\nThe visitor will get speedy update back from the server via web sockets. Other visitors will see the updated state of each joke when they first visit it. But they won't see updates from other users happen while at the page. It's time we send updates to all visitors as they occur. The PubSub library will help us do that by sending messages via specified topics, and we will use it via LeanJokersWeb.Endpoint.broadcast() and handle the messages via handle_info.\nWe will subscribe to a topic which we will name 'jokes'. When a visitor initiates an event we will broadcast the updated joke to other visitors. We will make sure that the other visitors' jokes will preserve their each toggled state.\nlib/lean_jokers_web/live/home.ex\ndefmodule LeanJokersWeb.Live.Home do\n  # ...\n  @topic \"jokes\"\n\n  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do\n    if connected?(socket) do\n      LeanJokersWeb.Endpoint.subscribe(@topic)\n    end\n\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  def handle_event(\"like_joke\", %{\"joke_id\" =&gt; joke_id} = _params, socket) do\n    # ...\n\n    state = %{\n      joke: toggled_joke,\n      sender: self()\n    }\n\n    LeanJokersWeb.Endpoint.broadcast(@topic, \"update_joke\", state)\n\n    {:noreply, assign(socket, :jokes, jokes)}\n  end\n\n  def handle_event(\"dislike_joke\", %{\"joke_id\" =&gt; joke_id} = _params, socket) do\n    # ...\n\n    state = %{\n      joke: toggled_joke,\n      sender: self()\n    }\n\n    LeanJokersWeb.Endpoint.broadcast(@topic, \"update_joke\", state)\n\n    {:noreply, assign(socket, :jokes, jokes)}\n  end\n\n  defp toggle_data(%Jokes.Joke{} = joke, :like) do\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  defp toggle_data(%Jokes.Joke{} = joke, :dislike) do\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  def handle_info(%{topic: \"jokes\", event: \"update_joke\", payload: %{joke: joke, sender: sender}}, socket) do\n    jokes = if (sender == self()) do\n      socket.assigns.jokes\n    else\n      [socket_joke | _rest ] = Enum.filter(socket.assigns.jokes, &amp;(&amp;1.id == joke.id))\n      joke = %{joke | has_liked: socket_joke.has_liked, has_disliked: socket_joke.has_disliked }\n\n      joke_id = joke.id\n\n      socket.assigns.jokes\n        |&gt; Enum.map(fn\n          %LeanJokers.Jokes.Joke{id: ^joke_id} -&gt; joke\n          element -&gt; element\n        end)\n    end\n\n    {:noreply, assign(socket, jokes: jokes)}\n  end\n\nend\n\n\nAs we are broadcasting the updated joke-data, we will see how different visitors will get a live-update:\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Your browser does not support this video\n\nAnd in closing...\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Why did the programmer use pattern matching?

While it's not the first time in history that we believe we are on the cusp of a great leap in AI advancement only to have an \"AI winter\" fall upon the field. This time it feels different, and rather than waning investments in the field, we see many diverse organizations (and individuals) running towards ChatGPT and other ML models to enhance their operations. We can see their uses from Search Algorithms to medical diagnoses. While some argue that privately owned and privately licensed models will always have the upper hand on open source models, the opposite sentiment can also be found. No matter which side of the argument you fall, it can't be denied that open source models can provide great value for whomever chooses to use them.\nIn this article we will dive into a few of these models and see what they are capable of. We will give an overview of different areas they can be used in and provide links for those who want to read their respective research paper. We will see models for sentiment analysis, image recognition, voice recognition, named entity recognition, text generation, and text-to-image generation. And as a surprise (SPOILER ALERT!), we may recognize that some of these models have multiple areas of applications.\n1. Sentiment analysis\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a field where we can harness the power of computers to make sense of human language. That's where we see models such as BERT or BART being used for different tasks. When it comes to sentiment analysis, we often see a BERT-type model being used. One example is XLM-RoBERTa, a multilingual model. In this example we can see it being used for classifying a text based on 3 different categories, and the probability that the text expresses a particular sentiment: \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nThe model in this case is cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment. It is further specialization of XLM-RoBERTa by training on 198M tweets. So to no surprise it can make sense of emojis as well. However, it has difficulty detecting sarcasm. There are particular ventures 1, 2 that seeks to rectify that!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        User generated image using Bing Image Creator\n    \n\n\nRead the paper introducing XLM-RoBERTa, from November 2019: Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale.\n2. Image classification with ResNet\nFrom Microsoft Research comes this open source Image Recognition model, Residual Network (ResNet). In its basic form, it will try to classify a single dominant object in a picture. Derived models comes with more features, such as detecting multiple objects in a picture.\nIn this example, the facebook/detr-rednet-101 model detects 3 objects, but gives two classifications for the car, either a truck or a car. It also successfully detects the two persons.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nThe ResNet model was introduced by Microsoft Research in December 2015 with the paper Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. The detection transformer (DETR) variant from Facebook AI was introduced in May 2020 with the paper End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers.\n3. Voice recognition with Whisper\nAutomatic speech recognition is a task where a model is used to enable a program to process human speech into text. So in essence, it is a speech-to-text model. Whisper is a popular model from OpenAI. It can be used for transcribing recordings and real-time speech recognition tasks.\nIn this example I'm posing the model with an important query:\n{{ imager_standard(\nasset='articles/elixir/opensource-models/whisper-01.png', \nalt='Speech is transcribed to \"Just because you can Fourier transform a cat doesn't mean you should, but really you really should.\".', \nclass='center'\n) }}\nWhisper was introduced in December 2022 in the paper Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision.\n4. Named Entity Recognition\nA useful task in processing language is extracting tokens from text, such as recognizing if a location or a person is mentioned, or perhaps some grammatical features. BERT is often used for this as this model is good at taking the context into account, and if multilingual support is needed, XLM-RoBERTa can be applied. \nIn this example we are using a RoBERTa model trained on English to detect persons, location, and organization:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nRead about the RoBERTa model, introduced in July 2019, from Facebook AI in the paper RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach.\n5. Text Generation\nThis is one of the tasks that has lead to some AI-craze of late, especially when a Text Generation model is being used as a chat partner. ChatGPT based on GPT versions 3+ and BARD based on PaLM, are two examples of this. But neither is currently on an open source license. HuggingChat is closer to open-source, but it is based on a LLaMA derivate and so it has a different kind of license attached (not any of the common open-source licenses like Appache 2.0 or MIT). There are more specialized conversational models, like facebook/blenderbot.\nBut if we want to take a look at a simpler text-generation task, without the conversational part, we can find many available models. DistilGPT2 is a smaller variant of GPT version 2, an open-source model. Here it is in action, where we can see it generate one word at a time.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Your browser does not support this video\n\nRead the paper behind GPT from OpenAI: Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners.\nAn up-and-coming large language model, Falcon, is another open-source model. Compared to the other alternatives here, this one is bigger and more resource-intensive. But work is being done to make it work on lighter commercial machines. \n6. Image Generation with Stable Diffusion\nStable Diffusion is a text-to-image diffusion model from Stability AI. Released in August 2022 it is an open-sourced licensed model that in short \"strives for both the open and responsible downstream use of the accompanying model\". \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Your browser does not support this video\n\nHugging Face has released a native application for Mac: Diffusers. Showcased above, we can choose one of the available versions, write a prompt, and number of steps (the higher the steps, in general, the higher the quality).\nA paid service to use the different versions of Stable Diffusion do also exist. Stability AI offers DreamStudio, where we can generate images right in the browser.\nBubbler: Text Summarization\nThere are models that have trained on texts that have been distorted and the models then should be able to recreate the text in its original form. This way of training has led to models like BART being well suited to tasks where they should distil a body of text in to smaller segments in a way where it does not lose too much information. \nAn example of this is facebook/bart-large-cnn, which is a BART model that has been trained on CNN Daily Mail. When summarizing the very first paragraph of Charles Dickens's \"A Tale of Two Cities\" we get:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\" he says. \"We were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way\". \"We had everything before us, we had nothing before us,\" he adds. \"The spring of hope\" was the winter of despair.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        User generated image using SDXL Beta\n    \n\n\nBubbler: Q/A\nQuestion and Answer is a task well suited for models that take context of words into account. The BERT-family of models are often used here. In general, there are in general three types of Q/A models: extractive, open-generative, and closed-generative. Extractive models can extract the answer from the provided context (be it text, table, or markup). Open-generative models glean the answer from the context and generate free text as an answer. Closed-generative models do not need a provided context. They are trained within a domain and the answer is purely generated by the model.\nExtractive model example\nWith the DistilBERT model, we can see how it finds the sentence that best can answer the question and extract it from the provided context:\n\nContext:\nQuantum machine learning is the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning programs. The most common use of the term refers to machine learning algorithms for the analysis of classical data executed on a quantum computer, i.e. quantum-enhanced machine learning. While machine learning algorithms are used to compute immense quantities of data, quantum machine learning utilizes qubits and quantum operations or specialized quantum systems to improve computational speed and data storage done by algorithms in a program.\nQuestion:\nWhat is an advantage of using quantum machine learning?\nAnswer:\nimprove computational speed and data storage\n\nThere are also contexts that can be in table-format. The Google/TAPAS model is used in this example to find the correct answer from a table-cell:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nTAPAS is a BERT-like model trained on English Wikipedia articles. It trained in a  self-supervised way where it learned to associate texts with tables, as well as learned numerical reasoning. Read more about the model in its accompanying paper from 2020 by Google Research: TAPAS: Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via Pre-training.\nOpen-generative model example\nAn open-generative model will rely on contexts to freely generate answers. The context is sometimes a database of documents, as is the case for Wikipedia Assistant. It provides a Long-Form Question Answering that can encode the question to fetch relevant documents (context) and a BART model that can parse the provided context to generate an answer.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is an advantage of using quantum machine learning?\nAnswer\nQuantum machine learning is an area of research that is still very much in its infancy. The most common use of the term refers to machine learning algorithms for the analysis of classical data executed on a quantum computer, i.e. \"quantum-enhanced machine learning\" (QML). The main advantage of QML is that it can be applied to a large number of data sets at once. For example, if you have a large set of data, and you want to learn how to classify it, you can use QML to do this. However, the problem is that QML can't be used to solve all of the data sets in the same way that a classical machine learning algorithm can. For instance, you might want to use a QML algorithm to solve the problem of how to categorize a large collection of images, but you can't use a classical algorithm to do the same thing with the same number of images. So, you need to use quantum machine learning to solve this problem. Another advantage is that you don't have to worry about the fact that the data set you're trying to classify is quantum.\n\n\n\n    Found contexts:\n    [\n  {\n    \"wikipedia_id\": \"30303286\",\n    \"title\": \"Decoding Reality\",\n    \"text\": \"Quantum computers offer a search advantage over classical computers by searching many database elements at once as a result of quantum superpositions. A sufficiently advanced quantum computer would break current encryption methods by factorizing large numbers several orders of magnitude faster than any existing classical computer. Any computable problem may be expressed as a general quantum search algorithm although classical computers may have an advantage over quantum search when using more efficient tailored classical algorithms. The issue with quantum computers is that a measurement must be made to determine if the problem is solved which collapses the superposition. Vedral points out that unintentional interaction with the environment can be mitigated with redundancy, and this would be necessary if we were to scale up current quantum computers to achieve greater utility, i.e. to utilize 10 qubits have a 100 atom quantum system so that if one atom decoheres a consensus will still be held by the other 9 for the state of the same qubit.\\n\",\n    \"section\": \"Section::::Contents.:\\\"Surfing the Waves: Hyper-Fast Computers\\\".\\n\",\n    \"start_paragraph_id\": 20,\n    \"end_paragraph_id\": 20,\n    \"start_character\": 0,\n    \"end_character\": 1055,\n    \"answer_similarity\": \"0.82\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"wikipedia_id\": \"44108758\",\n    \"title\": \"Quantum machine learning\",\n    \"text\": \"Quantum machine learning is an emerging interdisciplinary research area at the intersection of quantum physics and machine learning.

BERT and BART are models that looks to be used in similar contexts, but whereas BERT seem better suited for taking apart a sentence, BART seem better at distilling meaning from a larger body of text into a summarized body, and for text generation. We have also seen models for making sense of images (ResNet), voice recognition (Whisper), and image generation (Stable Diffusion). \nWe have given a quick overview over some of the most exciting models and how they are used.

That's the Traveling Salesman Problem in action! This classic challenge has entertained mathematicians and coders alike for ages. In this article, we'll see how to tackle it using the power of Elixir and genetic algorithms, mimicking nature's process of evolution to find surprisingly good routes.\nI was looking out my window and saw a delivery truck passing by on the street the other day. This got me thinking about a classic algorithm challenge: The Traveler Salesman Problem (TSP for short).\nThe challenge goes like this: A salesman has a list of cities they need to visit. They must visit each of them and return to their starting position. What is the shortest route they can take?\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nThis is of course a problem that has been solved in multiple ways,  thousands upon thousands of times over. The delivery driver has a route already preprogrammed - they don't need my help mulling it over. So why am I thinking about it?\nOne could say such everyday problems are more fun when applying algorithms to solve them, and I am looking for a reason to pull out my algorithmic toolbox. It's a fair statement! I recently put a new tool in that toolbox and I've been on the lookout for a reason to go nuts with it.\nThere are some interesting tools I can use, but there is a specific one I'm on the lookout for. So let me just quickly rifle through it:\n\n\nBrute force: The hammer of all hammers, brute forcing is not elegant but it gets the job done... eventually. If we were to use brute force to solve TSP we would be calculating each possible solution and then select the best one. The number of possible solutions to TSP is given by the formula (n-1)!/2. It's a factorial representing each possible combination of visits to the cities, and as it loops back to the beginning, the direction of the loop does not matter. So if the salesman had to visit 18 cities, this would be (18-1)!/2) which comes out to 1.8 × 1014 possible solutions. It's entirely possible, but I rifle on.\n\n\nNearest neighbor: A screwdriver in comparison, this algorithm is focused on the here-and-now with disregard for the larger picture. With a nearest neighbor the salesman would always travel to whichever city is closest to the city they are currently in. While this might see them cover a larger distance than brute forcing, it is much faster and can be good enough. But if you've read my previous article, you might suspect that I'm on the lookout for another tool.\n\n\nGenetic Algorithm: Now this is what I'm talking about! Genetic Algorithms (GA) might find the best possible route, but they might also find a solution that is just good enough. This is my hammer, saw, and ruler - all combined. It might look a bit freakish, but it's so versatile and fun to use! GA is inspired by evolutionary processes. Survival of the fittest and mutations will play a role in it finding a good enough solution. As long as we can define the solution as a \"chromosome\" and a way to measure the \"fitness\", GA will be possible to use.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nSo how would I use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find a short enough route for the salesman? Let's consider this; is it possible to describe a possible solution as a \"chromosome\"? I will say an emphatic yes! A route can be described as a series of cities in the order they will be visited. If we have the 3 cities 1, 2, and 3, then a chromosome could be a list: [1, 2, 3] or [2, 1, 3], and so on. As long as there are coordinates for each city it will be possible to calculate the distance between them, a.k.a: their \"fitness\" (where shorter is better).\nKnowing that I have a reasonable enough representation of a possible solution and a way to measure its fitness, let me share with you the plan!\nThe Plan\nThere is a classic movie series here in Sweden called \"The Jönsson Gang\". It's about a gang of mainly 3 thieves aiming for heists beyond their competence. Their leader, Charles Ingvar Jönsson, had an iconic line: \"I have a plan!\" His plans were very detailed, and would probably work most of the time. That is, if he and his gang weren't distracted by anything from a hotdog to a beer. Well, let me tell you: I have a plan and I'm all out of sausages!\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Less on the nose than \"The Purge\", and I can’t ask for more than that.\n\n    \n    \n\nWe are going to need:\n\n\nChromosomes and a way to generate them for the initial population.\n\n\nFitness function that will be able to give a measure to the chromosomes' \"fitness\".\nWhich means we need a function to measure the distance between each city in the chromosome, and not forget to measure the distance between the last city in the chromosome with the first. \n\n\nParents and how we select them. OK, that sounds weird, but if we are going to have a new generation of chromosomes we need something to base them off of. \nAnd we are not going to select them completely at random. This is not a singles' cruise!\n\n\nCrossover (and I'm so glad that this is the term chosen) between pairs of parents' chromosomes. \nEach pair of parents will produce 2 offsprings, where first offspring will select from parent a first, and second offspring will select from parent b first.\n\n\nMutation of chromosomes. This is a natural part of the parents producing offspring. This will introduce a unique trait to an offspring that is not necessarily found in the parent. If we are lucky we might see some Super Mutants! \n\n\nPruning of the population. The least fit chromosomes will leave place to the next generation. This dispassionately called process is less on the nose than \"The Purge\", and I can't ask for more than that.\n\n\nThe Evolutionary Loop! Each part that I've described is part of evolution. All that is left is passing on the new generation to the next and let nature have its fun. Since I'm not as elegant as dear Charles Ingvar Jönsson I will set a generational limit instead of a goal-oriented threshold for the loop.\n\n\nChromosomes are potential solutions\nWith the Travelling Salesman Problem the solution is a route, and a route is nothing but a series of places to visit. And by randomly selecting cities to visit, there is a potential that these routes collectively hold the key to the shortest route. And eventually, through evolution, the collection of randomly generated routes, survival of the fittest, and mutation, a generation will produce a good enough route.\nI think I've teased you enough. It's time to bring in the code (using Elixir)! I will represent the cities as a list of coordinates, and the chromosomes shall be the indices for each city. \n  @cities [\n    %{x: 10, y: 20}, %{x: 5, y: 15}, %{x: 12, y: 1},\n    %{x: 20, y: 10}, %{x: 7, y: 14}, %{x: 15, y: 3},\n    %{x: 15, y: 12}, %{x: 15, y: 10}, %{x: 20, y: 8},\n    %{x: 2, y: 14},  %{x: 3, y: 11}, %{x: 14, y: 7},\n    %{x: 5, y: 11}, %{x: 5, y: 23}, %{x: 20, y: 23}, \n    %{x: 7, y: 23}, %{x: 16, y: 12}, %{x: 25, y: 12}\n  ]\n\nA chromosome is the length of the list, with each gene representing the index to one of the cities. The foundation is laid when I initialize the population. Let me show you:\n  def initialize_population(population_size) do\n    chromosome_template = Enum.to_list(0..(Enum.count(@cities) - 1))\n\n    Enum.map(1..population_size, fn _ -&gt; Enum.shuffle(chromosome_template) end)\n  end\n\nNot to toot my own horn here, but doesn’t that look very simple? I introduce the chromosome_template that contains all the indices and shuffle it until I have created enough chromosomes.\n\nWhile we are talking about population and chromosomes, let me just warn you that we will see an addition on top of this. I will store a chromosome along with its distance (introduced just below this paragraph) in a map so we get a chromosome_data variable with a value like %{chromosome: [0,1,2], distance: 4.321}.\n\nThe shorter the better - the fitness function edition\nJust like Bilbo, it's not enough to go \"there\" - you need to have \"and back again\" too! The traveling salesman will be visiting each city and then return to their starting city, making a complete loop. The fitness function will sum up all the distances between each city and return that.\nA city's coordinate is represented by a map: %{x: 10, y: 20}. When we have two cities they can be: %{x: 10, y: 20} and %{x: 5, y: 15}. The distance between the cities requires a touch of math (or magic if you just want to skim this). The distance between two coordinated in a 2D field can be calculated with the help of Pythagoras: a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^ (or 2D Euclidean). And reframed for the two cities it would be the same as (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2 = c2. Then the distance is d=√(c2). And when we insert the values: d=√((10-5)2 + (20-15)2)≈7.\nRepresenting this calculation in code:\n  # Calculate the distance between two cities \n  def distance(%{x: x1, y: y1}, %{x: x2, y: y2}) do\n    # Using 2D Euclidean distance\n    dx = abs(x1 - x2)\n    dy = abs(y1 - y2)\n\n    (dx ** 2) + (dy ** 2)\n    |&gt; :math.sqrt()\n  end\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Oh, the pattern matching - unpacking values to variables right there in the function definitions!\n\n    \n    \n\nThis calculation should be done between each city in a chromosome. If you like some recursion and pattern matching, you will like this bit:\n​​  def distances([first, second]) do\n    city1 = Enum.at(@cities, first)\n    city2 = Enum.at(@cities, second)\n\n    distance(city1, city2)\n  end\n  def distances([first, second | tail]) do\n    city1 = Enum.at(@cities, first)\n    city2 = Enum.at(@cities, second)\n\n    distance(city1, city2) + distances([second | tail])\n  end\n\nOh, the pattern matching - unpacking values to variables right there in the function definitions! The first distances function will catch when a list is passed to it that contains only two elements, so it will return only the distance between the two cities in the list. But the second function will continue calling itself as long as there are more elements in the list.\nAnd if you are thinking that this does not measure the loop-back distance, you are correct! I saved that fun tidbit for the fitness_function:\n  def fitness_function(chromosome) do\n    last_to_first_elements = Enum.take(chromosome, 1) ++ Enum.take(chromosome, -1) \n\n    there = distances(chromosome)\n    and_back = distances(last_to_first_elements)\n\n    there + and_back\n  end\n\nOn top of taking the distance between the cities in a chromosome, the fitness_function will also take the last and first element and get its distance. Finally it will add up the distance there and back again and return the sum on a silver platter.\nWith this tidbit, each chromosome can be neatly packaged together with its distance in a data-package. A bit like this:\n    population = initialize_population(population_size)\n\n\n    chromosome_datas = \n      population\n      |&gt; Enum.map(\n        fn chromosome -&gt; %{chromosome: chromosome, distance: fitness_function(chromosome)} end\n        )\n\n\nAs initialize_population returns a list of chromosomes, it can be enumerated on and return new elements that package the chromosome with the distance returned from the fitness_function. Doing it this way means we will have the chromosome's fitness readily at hand. I do not consider distance or fitness a part of the chromosome, but rather additional data about the chromosome. \n\nThe not-a-singles-cruise way of selecting parents\n\"So you want offspring but want someone to do it for you?\" Good news, I’ve got the recipe for you! Given that there is a population of random chromosomes, it would be neat if the next generation were a bit better than the one previous. While I personally would like to say that millennials have it all figured out, we can still improve upon this generation. But for this to work we want to give a higher chance to chromosomes with shorter routes to produce offspring. This will mean that the offspring inherits the parents' good qualities (or bad, but that's why we want to prefer the parents with shorter routes).\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Selecting parents is not as much a cruise fare as it is a casino.\n\n    \n    \n\nThere is this thing called roulette wheel selection. To give a higher chance for the chromosomes with shorter distances to be selected I will just give them a larger pie of the wheel than the chromosome with longer distances. When I spin the wheel, every chromosome has the chance of being the winner but the likelihood that it falls on a chromosome with a longer route is smaller.\nMy foolproof plan for this is to summarize every route's distance and make an inverse ratio for them. On each spin of the wheel, there is a chance that a chromosome will be selected. The higher the inverse ratio is, the higher the chance that the wheel will stop at the chromosome.\nIn Elixir, I would do it like this:\n  def general_inverse_fitness(population_data) do\n    Enum.reduce(population_data, 0, fn data, acc -&gt; acc + 1 / data.distance end)\n  end\n\n  def select_parents(population_data, num_parents \\\\ 2) do\n    general_inverse_fitness =  general_inverse_fitness(population_data)\n\n    Enum.map(1..num_parents, fn _ -&gt; # Select n parents\n      random_value = :rand.uniform() * general_inverse_fitness\n      select_chromosome(population_data, random_value, 0)\n    end)\n  end\n\n  defp select_chromosome(population_data, target_fitness, acc_fitness) do\n    [chromosome_data | tail] = population_data\n\n    # The greater value from the distance function the less the new distance will be, \n    # so we promote the shorter routes before the longer routes\n    new_fitness = acc_fitness + 1 / chromosome_data.distance\n\n    if new_fitness &gt;= target_fitness do\n      chromosome_data\n    else\n      select_chromosome(tail, target_fitness, new_fitness)\n    end\n  end\n\nThe select_parents function is the entry-point. It will first summarize the inverse distances. In general the sum will become larger the shorter the distances are but it will depend on population size (meaning as a standalone metric it is not useful for comparing between different population sizes, but is meaningful within the population that it is used).\nWith the general_inverse_fitness, the function can continue with selecting parents. Whenever a new parent is selected, a new random value will be the target that a chromosome should achieve. If a chromosome does not achieve the target it will add to an accumulator that is added to the next chromosome's calculation. This is like the slowing of the roulette wheel. So selecting parents is not as much a cruise fare as it is a casino! \nCrossover and mutation: The Offsprings\nBefore we let the parents do what defines them in the evolutionary process, let's consider who should be pairing up with who? In the previous step I let the roulette wheel select parents. I will let the order in which they were selected define the pair of parents. Though it could be any kind of parental constellation - we are not limited to two parents, really - I feel like I want to keep it simple.\nEach pair of two parents will combine their chromosomes with each other in a crossover process. This part is important! So if you've skimmed this far, focus-up!\nIn a crossover I will take a random length of genes from one parent starting from a random position. The genes will be a subarray of cities, preserving the order from the parent chromosome. Then I will assemble a new chromosome and fill in the blanks for each element that is missing from the first subarray.\n\nExample \nA chromosome has length 6, the crossover will have a starting index of 2, and subarray length of 3. \nParent Chromosome A:                 [2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5]\nParent Chromosome B:                 [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 0]\nSubarray 1:                          [_, _, 1, 3, 4, _]\nAvailable genes from Chromosome B:   [2, 5, 0]\nFill in blanks with available genes: [2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 0]\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        A beautiful snowflake, if you may. Or a Super Mutant!\n\n    \n    \n\nBy combining the chromosomes this way I can preserve some of the route information and find new ones. But whichever parent's chromosome is selected first will have a higher impact for the new chromosome. For this reason I will crossover each pair of parents twice. Both parents' chromosomes will get to go first. It will be less fuss that way!\nBut an offspring is not only the combination of parents' chromosomes. Each offspring has the potential of being unique: a beautiful snowflake, if you may. Or a Super Mutant!\nThis is the role of mutation. To randomly introduce new characteristics to a chromosome. What my mutation function will do is to select at least one gene from the crossover chromosome and insert it at a random position. \n  def crossover(chromosome_1, chromosome_2) do\n\n    # 1. We select the parts of chromosome_1 randomly (the order is important)\n    #    It can be [_, _, B, C, A, _]\n    #    which means first selection will be [B, C, A], leaving D, E, F \n\n    cut_point_1 = :rand.uniform(Enum.count(chromosome_1) - 1) \n    cut_point_2 = :rand.uniform(Enum.count(chromosome_1) - 1) \n    [start_point, end_point] = [cut_point_1, cut_point_2] |&gt; Enum.sort()\n    selection = Enum.slice(chromosome_1, start_point..end_point) \n\n    # 2. We want to get the relationships that is present in chromosome_2\n    #    It can be [B, C, D, F, E, A]\n    #    Be mindful that we do not want to select either A, B, or C again. \n    #    This means that we should filter out every used gene: [D, F, E]\n    #    and start filling the missing pieces with the genes that are left.\n\n    available_genes = Enum.filter(chromosome_2, fn gene -&gt; !Enum.member?(selection, gene) end)\n    {prefix, suffix} = Enum.split(available_genes, start_point)\n\n    # 3. And then we assemble the chromosome from the different parts, \n    #    combining chromosome_1 and chromosome_2 genes\n    \n    prefix ++ selection ++ suffix\n  end\n\n  def mutation(chromosome) do\n    chromosome_length = Enum.count(chromosome)\n    portion_of_mutation = 0.1\n    least_num_of_mutations = 1\n\n    num_of_mutations = \n      round(chromosome_length * portion_of_mutation) \n      |&gt; max(least_num_of_mutations)\n\n    # For each number of mutations\n    # - Take random element\n    # - Insert at random position\n\n    mutating_genes = Enum.take_random(chromosome, num_of_mutations)\n    \n    template = Enum.filter(chromosome, fn gene -&gt; !Enum.member?(mutating_genes, gene) end)\n\n    Enum.reduce(mutating_genes, template, fn mutating_gene, acc -&gt; \n      random_pos = Enum.count(acc) - 1 |&gt; :rand.uniform()\n      List.insert_at(acc, random_pos, mutating_gene)\n    end)\n\nI would be amiss if I didn't point out that changing the position of just one element in the chromosome will have a huge impact on the overall chromosome information. One element contains not only the order a city is being visited, but it's also information about a connection from one city via the element to the next city. So keeping the mutation to minimal changes is good, as it otherwise would be resulting in a chromosome that is far different from either parent.\nMaking space for the new generation\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Dear Charles would be pretty terrified if he knew what I am about to do.\n\n    \n    \n\nCharles Ingvar Jönsson would probably know about the Swedish proverb: \"Finns det hjärterum så finns det stjärterum\". It means that one can always make space for anyone that wants to join, even if it is crowded: the crowd just needs to squeeze together more. So dear Charles would be pretty terrified if he knew what I am about to do.\nIn nature the population size would continuously fluctuate. But in my synthetically created world the size will be constant. That means: for any number of new offsprings, as many of the old population need to scoot over, and out!\nThere are many ways this can be done. Some are more imaginative than others. The Purge might have an idea on how this should be done. But I will just sort the old population by their fitness and keep just so many as are needed to keep a constant population size when the new generation is added. \n  def prune(sorted_population_data, prune_count) do\n    preserve_count = Enum.count(sorted_population_data) - prune_count\n\n    Enum.take(sorted_population_data, preserve_count)\n  end\n\nPrune. That sounds pretty cold. But that's the process where I simply \"cut off\" some branches that, in this case, are too long. This allows our population to become ever more fit for its task.\nThe snapshot of the process: prune(sorted_population_data, num_parents) ++ offsprings\nEvolving a better fit\nThe goal is to find a good-enough chromosome, or route, for our salesman. Each component plays a crucial part to get to that goal. But it's a process that requires many trial and errors. That's why there is randomness and pruning involved. The randomness allows the algorithm to try new and innovative routes never before considered. And while many of them are utterly poor, somewhere a nugget of gold is found.\nThe evolutionary loop will take in a population of chromosomes, select a cadre of parents and let them reproduce, followed by pruning the population to make space for the next generation. This new population will be passed on to another go at evolution. I reason that it is possible to have this loop continue until a good enough fit has been reached (such as when improvements from one generation to the next are stagnating). However, I've decided to use a hard generational limit instead because I'm feeling lazy.\nOnce the generational limit is reached, the chromosome with the shortest route in the current population will be returned.\n  def evolve(\n      sorted_population_data, \n      generation_n,  \n      %{generation_limit: generation_limit}\n    ) when generation_n == generation_limit do\n    \n    [chromosome_data] = Enum.take(sorted_population_data, 1)\n\n    total_fitness = general_inverse_fitness(sorted_population_data)\n\n    %{\n      distance: chromosome_data.distance, \n      chromosome: chromosome_data.chromosome, \n      generation: generation_n, \n      population_fitness: total_fitness\n    }\n  end\n  def evolve(sorted_population_data, generation_n, memo) do\n    %{num_parents: num_parents} = memo\n\n    parents = select_parents(sorted_population_data, num_parents)\n    offsprings = \n      parents \n      |&gt; Enum.chunk_every(2)\n      |&gt; Enum.flat_map(fn [parent_1, parent_2] -&gt; \n        [\n          TSP.crossover(parent_1.chromosome, parent_2.chromosome) |&gt; TSP.mutation(),\n          TSP.crossover(parent_2.chromosome, parent_1.chromosome) |&gt; TSP.mutation()\n        ]\n      end)\n      |&gt; Enum.map(fn chromosome -&gt; \n        %{chromosome: chromosome, distance: fitness_function(chromosome)}\n      end)\n\n    new_population_data = \n      prune(sorted_population_data, num_parents) ++ offsprings\n      |&gt; Enum.sort_by(\n        fn chromosome_data -&gt; chromosome_data.distance end,\n        :asc\n      )\n\n    evolve(new_population_data, generation_n + 1, memo)\n  end\n\n  def run(population_size \\\\ 100, generation_limit \\\\ 250, reproduction_rate \\\\ 0.3) do\n    population = initialize_population(population_size)\n\n    population_data = \n      population\n      |&gt; Enum.map(\n        fn chromosome -&gt; %{chromosome: chromosome, distance: fitness_function(chromosome)} end\n        )\n\n    sorted_population = Enum.sort_by(\n      population_data,\n      fn %{distance: distance} -&gt; distance  end,\n      :asc\n    )\n\n    num_parents = num_parents(population_size, reproduction_rate)\n\n    evolve(\n      sorted_population, \n      0, \n      %{\n        num_parents: num_parents, \n        generation_limit: generation_limit\n      }\n    )\n  end\n\nLet's say that someone like me created all these components and put them in a module called TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem in short). The way I would initiate the evolution would be to call the run function like this:\nTSP.run(aggregator_pid, 100, 1000, 0.3)\n\nThe response would be:\n%{\n  distance: 87.68567015836446,\n  chromosome: [10, 9, 1, 4, 13, 15, 0, 14, 17, 3, 8, 16, 6, 7, 11, 5, 2, 12],\n  generation: 1000,\n  population_fitness: 0.946812150303661\n}\n\nTo me, this looks like a functional algorithm. But don't take my word for it. Take these graphs instead:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nIn general, a population's (inverse) fitness will increase over time, but it will fluctuate as new and untested offsprings are introduced to the mix. A shortest distance may remain the current best alternative for generations upon generations, until the seeming equalibirum is punctuated by a burst of improvement. By combining these views, we can see that the population is ever improving - even if we can't detect it right away by the currently shortest route.\nHere's a peak at the routes (and at which generation) the algorithm discovered them during one run of the code:\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Your browser does not support this video\n   \n\n\n\n    population_size=100, generation_limit=1000, reproduction_rate=0.3\n\n\nTesting different scenarios\nThe complete code and livebook document can be found as a Github Gist. You are free to copy it and experiment with it as you see fit. I've certainly experimented with it, so let me share a few scenarios with you!\nEach scenario has either population changed, or parent ratio. Each scenario is showing two charts. The first chart shows how the sum of a population's general (inverse) fitness increases over the generations. The second chart shows the distance of each generation's shortest route.\nSome patterns can be seen for these scenarios. They all follow a taper-off curve, almost a logarithmic curve, for the population fitness; meaning the population see some major improvements through the initial generations and then the improvements are much smaller between generations later on. Another seeming pattern is the impact that a population size have. Small populations might struggle to find routes shorter than 100 before hitting the 1000:th generation. A similar is observed with a small parent ratio.\nWhen population is small (population=50, parent_ratio=0.3)  \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nWhen population is large (population=300, parent_ratio=0.3)  \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nWhen parent ratio is small (population=100, parent_ratio=0.1)  \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n  \nWhen parent ratio is large (population=100, parent_ratio=0.75)  \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n  \nReflecting on the generations past\nGenetic Algorithms are useful when we might want a solution that is \"good enough\", or if we don't know what a good solution might even look like. I was lucky today that I withstood the temptation of chasing a hotdog and managed to arrive at a solution (Charles Ingvar Jönsson would be proud, as well as the traveling salesman). I can't say if you managed to withstand it, but I'm happy that you allowed me to draw a route for you.\nI find Genetic Algorithms incredibly fun to work with. This has been the second time that I'm exploring the subject and I would like to do it again. Besides finding solutions to interesting problems I also find these additional benefits:\n\nTrying different data representations and structures can unlock huge perfomance improvements - which is fun!\nRecursion, pattern matching, and (if you check out the Livebook document) concurrency! Working with Genetic Algorithms is a good exercise to deepen Elixir skills.\nFitting each different component together in a recursive loop that makes sense is very satisfying!\n\nI hope you had a good time reading this, and hopefully learned something new. I sure did! \n","id":"https://abjork.land/articles/elixir/optimizing-travel-routes-applying-genetic-algorithms/","title":"Optimizing Travel Routes: Applying Genetic Algorithms to the Traveling Salesman Problem"},"https://abjork.land/articles/elixir/resize-image-uploads-with-liveview/":{"body":"\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Resize Image Uploads with LiveView\n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n    \n        \n        elixir\n        \n        phoenix\n        \n        liveview\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nIn this article we will see how to resize an image before uploading it to a Phoenix backend. We will do this by adding a profile image to the user in a basic Phoenix setup. This will take us through the process of modifying an existing schema, create and run a migration, write custom hooks, add file validation, and ultimately create a new file. So if you are up for the task and would like to follow along, here’s the resize/upload flow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites and Setup\n\nDocker\nElixir\nMix\n\nRun a postgres container: \ndocker run --name phoenix_db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=phoenix_pwd -e POSTGRES_USER=phoenix_usr -d -p 5432:5432 postgres\nIf you do not have a Phoenix application, run:\nmix phx.new my_app \n\nIf phx.new is not a recognized mix-command, install the command with mix archive.install hex phx_new. At the time of writing, this will install version 1.7.10.\n\nSetup the application to use the correct database credentails in ./config/dev.exs. Adjust in the top of the file so it corresponds with your docker container setup:\n# …\n# Configure your database\nconfig :my_app, MyApp.Repo,\n  username: \"phoenix_usr\",\n  password: \"phoenix_pwd\",\n  hostname: \"localhost\",\n  database: \"my_app_dev\",\n  stacktrace: true,\n  show_sensitive_data_on_connection_error: true,\n  pool_size: 10\n\n# …\n\nWith database configuration ready we can set up the database with mix ecto.create. We will then add a Phoenix LiveView authentication system by first running mix phx.gen.auth Accounts User users. And then run mix ecto.migrate.\nModify the User schema\nWe will have a profile image added to our new User model. The user will only ever have one of these and we will not preserve any kind of history beyond what the user currently has as their profile image. We plan to add a string field to the User model and schema to store the path for the image. Let’s create a migration file for this.\nFrom the CLI we run mix ecto.gen.migration add_profile_image.\nThis creates a new file  priv/repo/migrations/[timestamp]_add_profile_image.exs with the backbone for a migration-change. We will alter the table for users by adding a new field:\ndefmodule ArchAngler.Repo.Migrations.AddProfileImage do\n  use Ecto.Migration\n\n  def change do\n    alter table(:users) do\n      add :profile_image, :string\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nNext we will run this migration with mix ecto.migrate. \nHaving updated the database schema for the users table, we now turn to update our model accordingly. The model is defined in ./lib/my_app/accounts/user.ex. Let’s adjust the schema:\ndefmodule MyApp.Accounts.User do\n\n  # …\n  schema \"users\" do\n    # add the profile_image field here\n    field :profile_image, :string\n\n    timestamps()\n  end\n  #...\n\n  # add a new changeset function for the new field by the end of the module:\n  @doc \"\"\"\n  A User changeset for updating Profile Image\n  \"\"\"\n  def profile_image_changeset(user, attrs, _opts \\\\ []) do\n    user\n    |&gt; cast(attrs, [:profile_image])\n  end\n\nend\n\nWith the updated User model, we should update the context as well. We find it in ./lib/my_app/accounts.ex. Add the following function to the module:\n @doc \"\"\"\n  Returns an `%Ecto.Chageset{}` for updating the user profile_image.\n  \"\"\"\n  def change_profile_image(user, attrs \\\\ %{}) do\n    User.profile_image_changeset(user, attrs)\n  end\n\n  def update_profile_image(%User{} = user, attrs) do\n    user\n    |&gt; User.profile_image_changeset(attrs)\n    |&gt; Repo.update()\n  end\n\n\n\nThis will be used to create a form for the LiveView component.\nUpdate User Settings page\nWith updates to the User model, we can now update the LiveView component for the User Settings page. Currently the view has two forms: One for changing Email, and another for changing Password. We will add a new form for uploading and changing the Profile Image.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nWe will find the LiveView component in ./lib/my_app_web/live/user_settings_live.ex. In its render function, we will add our new form. Insert the following code above the email-form.\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div id=\"image-uploader-container\"&gt;\n          &lt;label&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"block text-sm font-semibold leading-6 text-zinc-800\"&gt;Profile Image&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;input\n              id=\"profile-image-uploader\"\n              type=\"file\"\n              accept=\"image/png, image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/webp\"\n              phx-hook=\"Resize\"\n            /&gt;\n          &lt;/label&gt;\n\n          &lt;%= if @image_error do %&gt;\n            &lt;p class=\"text-red-500\"&gt;&lt;%= @image_error %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;% end %&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        \n        &lt;.simple_form\n          for={@image_form}\n          id=\"profile_image_form\"\n          phx-submit=\"update_profile_image\"\n          phx-change=\"validate_profile_image\"\n        &gt;\n          &lt;%= if @profile_image do %&gt;\n            &lt;img src={@profile_image} alt=\"Profile Image\" /&gt;\n          &lt;% end %&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;div id=\"image-preview-container\"&gt;\n              &lt;%= if @resized_image_src do %&gt;\n                &lt;img src={@resized_image_src} alt=\"preview resized image\" /&gt;\n              &lt;% end %&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n\n          &lt;.input\n            id=\"profile-image-src-input\"\n            field={@image_form[:profile_image]}\n            type=\"hidden\"\n            value={@resized_image_src}\n            required\n          /&gt;\n\n          &lt;:actions&gt;\n            &lt;%= if @allow_image_upload do %&gt;\n              &lt;.button phx-disable-with=\"Changing...\" id=\"submit-image-btn\" class=\"\"&gt;\n                Submit image\n              &lt;/.button&gt;\n            &lt;% end %&gt;\n          &lt;/:actions&gt;\n        &lt;/.simple_form&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n\n      &lt;%!-- below is Email-form --%&gt;\n\nCouple of things to note here: we are currently referring to Phoenix functions and socket assignments that currently do not exist. We are missing these functions in the LiveView component:\nvalidate_profile_image, which will be called for every change in the form.\nupdate_profile_image, which will be called upon form-submit.\nThe following socket assignments are missing: \nimage_form, a form-map that holds the field we want to parse.\nimage_error, a variable that we will add an error message to, if needed.\nprofile_image, a variable that will hold the current profile image.\nresized_image_src, will hold a data URL of a resized image if validated.\nallow_image_upload, will be false until validated.\nOn top of these Elixir-related changes, we will also make use of LiveView’s JavaScript Interoperability capabilities via its hooks. We will need a Resize hook, which will be responsible to resize an image to within specified parameters, and once that is done, it will update the value of the hidden input field.\nLet’s start with the Elixir updates in the LiveView component (user_settings_live.ex). We will add the assignments first. These are added into the second mount function of the component:\ndef mount(_params, _session, socket) do\n    user = socket.assigns.current_user\n    email_changeset = Accounts.change_user_email(user)\n    password_changeset = Accounts.change_user_password(user)\n\n    # Let’s get the changeset for the image\n    profile_image_changset = Accounts.change_profile_image(user)\n\n    socket =\n      socket\n      |&gt; assign(:current_password, nil)\n      |&gt; assign(:email_form_current_password, nil)\n      |&gt; assign(:current_email, user.email)\n      |&gt; assign(:email_form, to_form(email_changeset))\n      |&gt; assign(:password_form, to_form(password_changeset))\n      |&gt; assign(:trigger_submit, false)\n     \n     # Our new assigns are added here\n      |&gt; assign(:image_form, to_form(profile_image_changset))\n      |&gt; assign(:image_error, false)\n      |&gt; assign(:profile_image, user.profile_image)\n      |&gt; assign(:resized_image_src, false)\n      |&gt; assign(:allow_image_upload, false)\n\n    {:ok, socket}\n  end\n\nNext up would be adding the event handlers for validate_profile_image and update_profile_image. But for the validation part it would be best to have a separate module that can validate by file size and type. This module’s validate function can then be called in our LiveView component. Create the file ./lib/my_app/image_validator.ex with the following content:\ndefmodule MyApp.ImageValidator do\n  def validate_image(data_url, allowed_file_size, allowed_file_types)\n      when is_binary(data_url) and is_integer(allowed_file_size) and is_list(allowed_file_types) do\n    # Extract the media type and the base64 part from the data_url\n    [meta_data, base64] = String.split(data_url, \",\")\n\n    [media_type, _] = String.replace(meta_data, \"data:\", \"\") |&gt; String.split(\";\")\n\n    # Decode the base64 part and get the binary data\n    binary_data = Base.decode64!(base64)\n\n    # Get the file size in bytes\n    file_size = byte_size(binary_data)\n\n    # Get the file extension from the media type\n    file_ext = String.split(media_type, \"/\") |&gt; Enum.at(1) |&gt; String.replace_suffix(\"\", \"\")\n\n    # Check if the file extension is allowed\n    case Enum.member?(allowed_file_types, file_ext) do\n      true -&gt;\n        # Check if the file size is less than or equal to 2MB\n        case file_size &lt;= allowed_file_size do\n          true -&gt;\n            {:ok, data_url}\n\n          false -&gt;\n            # Return an error message for invalid file size\n            {:error, \"Image size must be less than or equal to #{allowed_file_size}\"}\n        end\n\n      false -&gt;\n        # Return an error message for invalid file extension\n        {:error, \"Image file type must be jpg, jpeg, png, or gif\"}\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nLet’s write out our event handler for validate_profile_image back in user_settings_live.ex:\n  def handle_event(\n        \"validate_profile_image\",\n        %{\"user\" =&gt; %{\"profile_image\" =&gt; profile_image}},\n        socket\n      ) do\n    case MyApp.ImageValidator.validate_image(profile_image, 2 * 1024 * 1024, ~w(jpg jpeg gif png webp)) do\n      {:ok, data_url} -&gt;\n        {:noreply,\n         socket\n         |&gt; assign(resized_image_src: data_url, allow_image_upload: true, image_error: false)}\n\n      {:error, message} -&gt;\n        {:noreply, socket |&gt; assign(allow_image_upload: false, image_error: message)}\n    end\n  end\n\n\nWe can see how we are using pattern matching to unpack profile_image from the incoming parameters variable. This data is passed into the validate_image function, along with the maximum allowed file size (2MB) and allowed file types. As the function returns either an ok atom along with the image data, or an error and message, we will adjust the socket assignments accordingly. \nNow, let’s add the event handler for update_profile_image in the same user_settings_live.ex, along with two helper functions:\n  def handle_event(\n        \"update_profile_image\",\n        %{\"user\" =&gt; %{\"profile_image\" =&gt; profile_image}},\n        socket\n      ) do\n    \n    # Make sure that the image data is still valid\n    case MyApp.ImageValidator.validate_image(\n           profile_image,\n           2 * 1024 * 1024,\n           ~w(jpg jpeg gif png webp)\n         ) do\n     \n      {:ok, data_url} -&gt;\n        handle_update_profile_image(data_url, socket)\n\n      {:error, message} -&gt;\n        {:noreply, socket |&gt; assign(allow_image_upload: false, image_error: message)}\n    end\n  end\n\n  defp handle_update_profile_image(profile_image, socket) do\n    [meta_data, base64] = String.split(profile_image, \",\")\n\n    file_name = generate_file_name()\n\n    image_binary = Base.decode64!(base64)\n\n    destination =\n      Path.join([:code.priv_dir(:my_app), \"static\", \"uploads\", Path.basename(file_name)])\n\n    File.write!(destination, image_binary)\n\n    src_path = ~p\"/uploads/#{Path.basename(destination)}\"\n\n    prev_file_name = socket.assigns.current_user.profile_image\n\n    case Accounts.update_profile_image(socket.assigns.current_user, %{profile_image: src_path}) do\n      {:ok, _} -&gt;\n        # If update was ok, then remove previous image\n        case String.length(prev_file_name) &gt; 0 do\n          true -&gt;\n            previous_file_path =\n              Path.join([\n                :code.priv_dir(:my_app),\n                \"static\",\n                \"uploads\",\n                Path.basename(prev_file_name)\n              ])\n\n            File.rm!(previous_file_path)\n        end\n\n        # Send back the updated image path and reset upload assignments\n        {\n          :noreply,\n          socket\n          |&gt; assign(:profile_image, src_path)\n          |&gt; assign(:resized_image_src, false)\n          |&gt; assign(:allow_image_upload, false)\n        }\n\n      {:error, _} -&gt;\n        {:noreply, socket |&gt; assign(image_error: \"Could not update new image to user.\")}\n    end\n  end\n  \n  defp generate_file_name do\n    # Get the current timestamp in milliseconds\n    timestamp = DateTime.utc_now() |&gt; DateTime.to_unix(:millisecond)\n\n    # Generate a random string of 8 characters\n    random_string = :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(8) |&gt; Base.encode64(padding: false)\n\n    # Concatenate the timestamp and the random string with a dash\n    \"#{timestamp}-#{random_string}\"\n  end\n\n\n\nThe new function will create a file in the directory at ./priv/static/uploads. Create the directory if it does not exist. Then define it as one of the allowed static directories with the function static_paths in ./lib/my_app_web.ex:\n  def static_paths, do: ~w(assets fonts images uploads favicon.ico robots.txt)\n\nWe will be making use of a JavaScript LiveView Hook here as well. It will be mounted on a file-input and resize any incoming images and set the resulting data URL (including base64 bytestring) to the hidden input-field. When that is done, it will trigger a change-event on the form which in turn will trigger the validate-change hook in Phoenix. \nLets first create a JavaScript module that can resize an image. Create the file ./assets/js/image_resizer.js with the following content:\nexport function resizeImage(image, maxWidth, maxHeight) {\n    let scale = 1\n    let width = image.naturalWidth\n    let height = image.naturalHeight\n\n    if (width &gt; maxWidth) {\n        scale = image.width / maxWidth\n        width = maxWidth\n        height = image.height / scale\n    }\n\n    if (height &gt; maxHeight) {\n        scale = image.height / maxHeight\n        height = maxHeight\n        width = image.width / scale\n    }\n\n    width = Math.floor(width)\n    height = Math.floor(height)\n\n    const canvas = document.createElement(\"canvas\")\n    canvas.width = width\n    canvas.height = height\n\n    const context2D = canvas.getContext(\"2d\")\n    context2D.drawImage(image, 0, 0, width, height)\n\n    return canvas.toDataURL();\n}\n\nThe let’s create the Resize hook and use this function in ./assets/js/app.js: \n// …\n// add import for the resizeImage function\nimport { resizeImage } from \"./image_resizer\"\n\n// Then create our hook\nlet Hooks = {}\nHooks.Resize = {\n    mounted() {\n        \n        const maxWidth = 250\n        const maxHeight = 250\n\n        let imageInput = document.getElementById(\"profile-image-uploader\")\n\n        // Inspired by blog-post https://imagekit.io/blog/how-to-resize-image-in-javascript/\n        imageInput.addEventListener('change', function (e) {\n            if (e.target.files) {\n\n                let imageFile = e.target.files[0];\n    \n                var reader = new FileReader();\n                reader.onload = function (e) {\n                    const image = new Image()\n                    image.onload = () =&gt; {\n                        const dataUrl = resizeImage(image, maxWidth, maxHeight)\n\n                        if (dataUrl.length === 0) {\n                            return;\n                        }\n\n                        let resizedImage = document.getElementById(\"image-preview\") ?? new Image()\n                        resizedImage.setAttribute(\"id\", \"image-preview\")\n                        resizedImage.setAttribute(\"alt\", \"Preview\")\n                        resizedImage.src = dataUrl\n\n                        document.getElementById(\"image-preview-container\").appendChild(resizedImage)\n\n                        hiddenInput = document.getElementById(\"profile-image-src-input\")\n                        hiddenInput.value = dataUrl\n                        hiddenInput.dispatchEvent(\n                            new Event(\"input\", {bubbles: true})\n                        )\n                    }\n\n                    image.src = e.target.result\n                }\n\n                reader.readAsDataURL(imageFile);\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n\n// and let’s make it available to our LiveView socket:\nlet liveSocket = new LiveSocket(\"/live\", Socket, {params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken}, hooks: Hooks})\n\n// …\n\nWe see how we can set a preview image from the dataUrl produced by the resizeImage function and append it into a container in the DOM. We are also setting it as a value on the hidden input element. This alone won’t trigger the form to emit a change event, so we explicitly do that with a dispatchEvent on the element. That in turn will trigger the phx-change instruction which will emit the validate_profile_image event, and if all is valid then a “Submit image” button will appear. \nIn summary\nPhoenix LiveView is all about reacting to events. We can attach hooks and event handlers on most elements we choose. In this scenario we upload a file indirectly via a LiveView form, which has hooks and events that takes care of resizing and validating uploads whenever a new file has been chosen.\nWe take care of resizing on the client-side. We emit a change-event on the form to initialize a server-side validation on the resized image data. If everything appears OK, the upload is greenlit on the client and the user may submit the image. Upon submitting a new event is taking place and we will again reaffirm that the image data is valid before we create a file, store the updated image path to the user and then remove the old image.\nHere’s our updated User Settings page:\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n","id":"https://abjork.land/articles/elixir/resize-image-uploads-with-liveview/","title":"Resize Image Uploads with LiveView"},"https://abjork.land/articles/exploration/":{"body":"","id":"https://abjork.land/articles/exploration/","title":"Exploration"},"https://abjork.land/articles/exploration/api-platform/":{"body":"\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Discovering API Platform\n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n    \n        \n        symfony\n        \n        api platform\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe story of API Platform is a story of standards. Some would say it is best-in-class API framework! \nIt is a stand-alone library in the PHP flora, and is a popular pairing with Symfony projects. \nIn this article we will discover what API Platform is, from initial setup to basic usage.\nLet's tickle some endpoints!\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        REST is for data what SOAP is for dirt.\n\n    \n    \n    Dave Winer, pioneer of web services (including SOAP)\n\n    \n \nA RESTful API is the starting point for any API Framework project. \nWhile GraphQL may be related to REST the way that REST was to SOAP, RESTful API:s are still popular. And in fact,\nAPI Platform supports both. So let's get acquainted with this PHP library!\nThe setup\nWe will leverage Symfony for building APIs. As API Platform is paired with Symfony the same way that wine and cheese is, \nthis will be our starting point:\ncomposer create-project symfony/skeleton:\"6.2.*\" apiplatform\nSymfony loves to make a developer's life easy, something called symfony/flex has been installed for us, so we can move \nin to the project directory (cd apiplatform) and install API Platform: composer require api. Not only will this \ninstall API Platform, it also adds some additional configurations such as exposing an api-route, such as /api.\nVisiting the api route right now will display an OpenAPI (swagger) UI 👇\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        We don't do this because it is easy, we do it because we thought it would be easy.\n\n    \n    \nAdding resources\nBeing a lazy developer, it is nice being spoiled by Symfony. We just saw that we have set up API Platform just by the virtue \nof having symfony/flex handling setting up the configurations for us. We also saw that we do not have any resources or \noperations available in our API. So would it not be so very endearing to have another tool helping us out here? \nIndeed, it would! It is called maker-bundle and it allows us to specify an entity, its fields, and if it should be available \nin our API. We install it with symfony require maker (again, symfony/flex allows us to be so incredible lazy as not even \ntyping out the whole package name).\nOnce it is installed, we will make use of it with bin/console make:entity to create our first entity: a cassette tape.\nIt will be called Cassette, it will be exposed in the API, and it will have a single field to start with:\napiplatform ➤ bin/console make:entity\n\nClass name of the entity to create or update (e.g. AgreeableElephant):\n&gt; Cassette\n\nMark this class as an API Platform resource (expose a CRUD API for it) (yes/no) [no]:\n&gt; yes\n\ncreated: src/Entity/Cassette.php\ncreated: src/Repository/CassetteRepository.php\n\nEntity generated! Now lets add some fields!\nYou can always add more fields later manually or by re-running this command.\n\nNew property name (press &lt;return&gt; to stop adding fields):\n&gt; title\n\nField type (enter ? to see all types) [string]:\n&gt;\n\nField length [255]:\n&gt;\n\nCan this field be null in the database (nullable) (yes/no) [no]:\n&gt;\n\nupdated: src/Entity/Cassette.php\n\nAdd another property? Enter the property name (or press &lt;return&gt; to stop adding fields):\n&gt;\n\nSuccess!\n\nNext: When you are ready, create a migration with php bin/console make:migration\n\nWe are about to start using a database. Our basic project comes with a Docker Compose setup configured to run a \nPostgreSQL database, so let's get the container started: docker-compose up -d \n\nAlternatively we can switch the database to a MariaDB from the comfort of the CLI:\nbin/console make:docker:database\n\nOur next task is to make a migration file. This will contain our Entity schema and will be available at ./migrations/. We create it with:\nsymfony php bin/console make:migration\n\nsymfony is a CLI-tool that in this context will infer docker environments for us, such as database connection details. Without it, you would get a \"connection refused\" error until you update your .env-file with the correct connection details.\n\nHaving a new migration-file, we will execute it by running symfony php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate. If we revisit our /api route, we will see that we have all the possible operations available to us that we might like. Maybe too many? 🤔\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nYou might have noticed a spider in your API. Don't worry, it's just Webby.\nEither through an API client like Postman or from the comfort of the browser, API Platform is already allowing us to interact with our defined entity. And we haven't written a line of code yet. Let's give it a try! \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    Your browser does not support this video\n\nNow let's imagine, this is just too much freedom for us. We rather not have all these options, or these vocabularies at our fingertips. Let's say that we never ever want to replace a Cassette; PUT will not be in our API repertoire!\nThis is our current Cassette entity (previously generated by the make:entity command):\n&lt;?php\n\nnamespace App\\Entity;\n\nuse ApiPlatform\\Metadata\\ApiResource;\nuse App\\Repository\\CassetteRepository;\nuse Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping as ORM;\n\n#[ORM\\Entity(repositoryClass: CassetteRepository::class)]\n#[ApiResource]\nclass Cassette\n{\n    #[ORM\\Id]\n    #[ORM\\GeneratedValue]\n    #[ORM\\Column]\n    private ?int $id = null;\n\n    #[ORM\\Column(length: 255)]\n    private ?string $title = null;\n\n    public function getId(): ?int\n    {\n        return $this-&gt;id;\n    }\n\n    public function getTitle(): ?string\n    {\n        return $this-&gt;title;\n    }\n\n    public function setTitle(string $title): self\n    {\n        $this-&gt;title = $title;\n\n        return $this;\n    }\n}\n\n\nWe see some metadata about this entity in the form of PHP attributes. We have ORM-mapping in the form of marking the class as an Entity along with which repository it should use. We also see that it is marked as an ApiResource. API Platform will infer all relevant fields to expose and the methods to interact with them. It really wants to help us. But how can we define that API Platform should not have a PUT request available for it?\nBy expanding the ApiResource attribute with an operations argument we can specify which requests we want to enable for the entity.\n&lt;?php \n// ...\n#[ApiResource(\n    operations: [\n        new Get(),\n        new GetCollection(),\n        new Post(),\n        new Delete(),\n        new Patch()\n    ]\n)]\n\nThese operations are brought from the ApiPlatform\\Metadata namespace and correspond with each type of request we want to enable. We bring in all the operations here but for the PUT operation.\n\nMost of these operations are straight forward, but they hint at something fundamental. There is something called Collection operations, so there are also something called Item operations. Post och GetCollection are collection operations. This means that they do not require any item identificator, which Item operations do. \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        No body puts PUT in a corner!\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nSo a mixtape is not much without any songs. We will create an entity for this and create two collections on Cassette to relate to the songs. It will have a sideA collection of songs, and a sideB collection of songs. We will againg enjoy the ease that is the bin/console make:entity command by adding the following fields:\n\n\nbin/console make:entity Song:\n\ntitle [string]\nartist [string]\nduration [integer] (duration in seconds)\n\n\n\nupdate database for the new entity:\n\nsymfony php bin/console make:entity\nsymfony php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate\n\n\n\nbin/console make:entity Cassette (allows us to update its fields): \n\nsideA [ManyToMany -&gt; Song, no corresponding field on Song]\nsideB [ManyToMany -&gt; Song, no corresponding field on Song]\n\n\n\nModify the ManyToMany mapping on Cassette with JoinTable (brought in from the Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping namespace):\n\n\n    #[ORM\\ManyToMany(targetEntity: Song::class)]\n    #[JoinTable(name: 'side_a_songs')]\n    private Collection $sideA;\n\n    #[ORM\\ManyToMany(targetEntity: Song::class)]\n    #[JoinTable(name: 'side_b_songs')]\n    private Collection $sideB;\n\n\nUpdate the new relations.\n\nsymfony php bin/console make:entity\nsymfony php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate\n\n\n\nIt may be that the new entity has not been marked as an ApiResource, to remedy that we will simply prepend the Song class with the ApiResource attribute. This will again expose all the operations we might want. So taking this opportunity to populate our database with some songs we can make a POST request to https://localhost:8000/api/songs (or whatever port you have your local server running at). May I suggest adding the following payload with the request:\n{\n  \"title\": \"Never Gonna Give You Up\",\n  \"artist\": \"Rick Astley\",\n  \"duration\": 214\n}\n\nAfter adding a few songs, we can fetch them at https://localhost:8000/api/songs with a GET request. It would return the following response:\n{\n  \"@context\": \"/api/contexts/Song\",\n  \"@id\": \"/api/songs\",\n  \"@type\": \"hydra:Collection\",\n  \"hydra:totalItems\": 4,\n  \"hydra:member\": [\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"/api/songs/1\",\n      \"@type\": \"Song\",\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"title\": \"Never Gonna Give You Up\",\n      \"artist\": \"Rick Astley\",\n      \"duration\": 214\n    },\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"/api/songs/2\",\n      \"@type\": \"Song\",\n      \"id\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"If I Could Turn Back Time\",\n      \"artist\": \"Cher\",\n      \"duration\": 239\n    },\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"/api/songs/3\",\n      \"@type\": \"Song\",\n      \"id\": 3,\n      \"title\": \"Walking On Sunshine\",\n      \"artist\": \"Katrina &amp; The Waves\",\n      \"duration\": 239\n    },\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"/api/songs/4\",\n      \"@type\": \"Song\",\n      \"id\": 4,\n      \"title\": \"Like a Virgin\",\n      \"artist\": \"Madonna\",\n      \"duration\": 219\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPerhaps we could improve the response for the songs so we could get duration in a minute:seconds format? We could do that by adding a dynamic field! As long as we use a language that API Platform understands, we won't have to add any special configurations!\nAdd the following method to App\\Entity\\Song:\n&lt;?php\n// ...\n    public function getFormattedDuration(): ?string\n    {\n        $duration = $this-&gt;duration ?? 0;\n        $minutes = $duration &gt; 60 ? (int)($duration / 60) : 0;\n        $seconds = $duration &gt; 60 ? $duration % 60 : $duration;\n\n        return sprintf('%d:%02d', $minutes, $seconds);\n    }\n\nAnd just like that we get back the following for the first song:\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"/api/songs/14\",\n      \"@type\": \"Song\",\n      \"id\": 14,\n      \"title\": \"Never Gonna Give You Up\",\n      \"artist\": \"Rick Astley\",\n      \"duration\": 214,\n      \"formattedDuration\": \"3:34\"\n    }\n\nSo far, this has been a pleasant journey. But can we add a song at a time to the cassette and get a list of songs from the Cassette resource? This will require a bit more work. While we have an endpoint to setup the whole lists of songs with a one-off PATCH request, we do not have an endpoint to add one song at a time. Another challenge is the nature of cassettes! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nA traditional cassette has 2 sides; an A-side and a B-side. Each side can contain upto about 30 minutes of audio. We will add a method called addSong which will add songs to the A-side until it is full and then continue to add to the B-side. We will have a method to calculate the length occupied for each side called totalLength and another method called sideAddable to the Cassette class. We will modify the methods addSideA and addSideB to add the control if it can add another song.\n    // ./src/Entity/Cassette\n&lt;?php\n\n    // ...\n\n    public function addSong(Song $song): self\n    {\n        if (!$this-&gt;sideA-&gt;contains($song) &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;sideAddable($song, $this-&gt;sideA)) {\n            $this-&gt;addSideA($song);\n        } else {\n            $this-&gt;addSideB($song);\n        }\n\n        return $this;\n    }\n    \n    public function addSideA(Song $song): self\n    {\n        if (!$this-&gt;sideA-&gt;contains($song) &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;sideAddable($song, $this-&gt;sideA)) {\n            $this-&gt;sideA-&gt;add($song);\n        }\n\n        return $this;\n    }\n    \n    public function addSideB(Song $song): self\n    {\n        if (!$this-&gt;sideB-&gt;contains($song) &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;sideAddable($song, $this-&gt;sideB)) {\n            $this-&gt;sideB-&gt;add($song);\n        }\n\n        return $this;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @param Collection&lt;Song&gt; $songs\n     * @return int\n     */\n    public function totalLength(Collection $songs): int\n    {\n        $sum = 0;\n\n        foreach ($songs as $song) {\n            $sum += $song-&gt;getDuration() ?? 0;\n        }\n\n        return $sum;\n    }\n\n    protected function sideAddable(Song $candidateSong, Collection $sideSongs): bool\n    {\n        $allowedLength = 30 * 60;\n\n        return $allowedLength &gt; ($this-&gt;totalLength($sideSongs) + $candidateSong-&gt;getDuration());\n    }\n\nWe will add a controller to handle when songs are added to a cassette. After this, we will use the controller when we register a new API route. You will see that we pass an EntityManagerInterface to the controller. This will be automaticallly resolved by Symsony's Dependency Injection container. It will be used to loop up the song in the database and store it to a cassette. The controller will return a 201 OK status for successful creation of a new relation, 400 BAD REQUEST for requests without a required body parameter (songId), or 404 NOT FOUND if a song is not found. If you look oveer the class you will see that we don't look up the Cassette to see if it is present. In a __invoke method we assume a cassette has already been found, this means that Symfony in conjunction with the ORM will already have processed the lookup and will handle returning a 404 for us if it was not found. \n//  ./src/Controller/CassetteSongController.php\n\n&lt;?php\n\ndeclare(strict_types=1);\n\nnamespace App\\Controller;\n\nuse App\\Entity\\Cassette;\nuse App\\Entity\\Song;\nuse Doctrine\\ORM\\EntityManagerInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\AbstractController;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Response;\n\nclass CassetteSongController extends AbstractController\n{\n    public function __construct(\n        private readonly EntityManagerInterface $entityManager\n    ){}\n    public function __invoke(Cassette $cassette, Request $request = null): Response\n    {\n        if ($request !== null) {\n            $content = $request-&gt;getContent();\n            $data = json_decode($content, true);\n            $songId = $data['songId'] ?? false;\n\n            if (!$songId) {\n                return $this-&gt;json(\n                    ['description' =&gt; 'Missing required key \"songId\"'],\n                    Response::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST\n                );\n            }\n\n            $songRepository = $this-&gt;entityManager-&gt;getRepository(Song::class);\n            $song = $songRepository-&gt;findOneBy(['id' =&gt; $songId]);\n\n            if ($song === null) {\n                return $this-&gt;json(['description' =&gt; 'Song was not found'], Response::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);\n            }\n\n            $cassette = $cassette-&gt;addSong($song);\n            $this-&gt;entityManager-&gt;flush($cassette);\n        }\n\n        return $this-&gt;json(\n            [\n                'description' =&gt; 'Song was added!',\n            ],\n            Response::HTTP_CREATED\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        To be or not to be, that is the question. Well, actually, there are many other questions, like \"why that controller though?\"\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\nSo what to do with that controller? As we see, it will take an instance of the Cassette class and a request object. We will go into the Cassette class and expand the API definitions. This will be less magic (but not totally without some sourcery), and more definitions. We add a new Post-request to the API Resource, define its route, the controller to handle it, and its response values.\n&lt;?php\n\n#[ApiResource(\n    operations: [\n        // ... \n        new Post(\n            uriTemplate: '/cassettes/{id}/songs',\n            controller: CassetteSongController::class,\n            openapiContext: [\n                'summary' =&gt; 'Add a Song to a cassette',\n                'requestBody' =&gt; [\n                    'content' =&gt; [\n                        'application/json' =&gt; [\n                            'schema' =&gt; [\n                                'type' =&gt; 'object',\n                                'properties' =&gt; [\n                                    'songId' =&gt; [\n                                        'type' =&gt; 'integer'\n                                    ]\n                                ]\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                ],\n                'responses' =&gt; [\n                    '201' =&gt; [\n                        'description' =&gt; 'Song added successfully'\n                    ],\n                    '400' =&gt; [\n                        'description' =&gt; 'Missing required key'\n                    ],\n                    '404' =&gt; [\n                        'description' =&gt; 'Cassette or Song not found'\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ]\n)]\nclass Cassette\n// ...\n\nIn the route for the endpoint we have added a placeholder, {id}. This id corresponds to the Cassette entity we want to add to, and Symfony will fetch the correct one for us and insert into the controller's __invoke method. In the POST body we define the schema to have a songId with an integer. Having added this, we will see a new route and schema for it on localhost:8000/api.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nWe can now create a Cassette, multiple songs, and add songs to a cassette. Having done that, when we fetch a Cassette with a GET request we will get back the songs it has. But something looks a bit off.\nGET https://127.0.0.1:8000/api/cassettes/1\n{\n  \"@context\": \"/api/contexts/Cassette\",\n  \"@id\": \"/api/cassettes/1\",\n  \"@type\": \"Cassette\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"Mix Tape #1\",\n  \"sideA\": [\n    \"/api/songs/1\",\n    \"/api/songs/2\",\n    \"/api/songs/3\",\n    \"/api/songs/4\",\n    \"/api/songs/5\",\n    \"/api/songs/6\",\n    \"/api/songs/7\",\n    \"/api/songs/8\"\n  ],\n  \"sideB\": [\n    \"/api/songs/10\",\n    \"/api/songs/11\",\n    \"/api/songs/12\",\n    \"/api/songs/13\",\n    \"/api/songs/14\"\n  ]\n}\n\nWe can see that we have 8 songs on side A, and 5 on side B. But we would like to get the song, artist, and duration for each. So what are these strings we get? It looks like URLs, and while they functions as this too they are API Platform's way to identify each entity, or IRIs (International Resource Identifiers).\nWe will modify how API Platform returns the songs when we fetch a cassette. We will do this by defining a normalization-group in Cassette and map the Song class to also use this group.\n// ./src/Entity/Cassette\n&lt;?php\n// ...\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Serializer\\Annotation\\Groups;\n// ...\n\n#[ApiResource(\n    // ...\n    normalizationContext: [\n        'groups' =&gt; ['read:cassette']\n    ]\n)]\nclass Cassette\n{\n    // ...\n    // add this group to the fields you want to expose in the API\n    #[Groups(['read:cassette'])]\n    private ?string $title = null;\n\n    // ...\n    #[Groups(['read:cassette'])]\n    private Collection $sideA;\n\n    // ...\n    #[Groups(['read:cassette'])]\n    private Collection $sideB;\n\n    // ...\n}\n\nAnd for the magic of it all we will add this group in the Song class as well.\n// ./src/Entity/Song\n\n&lt;?php\n\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Serializer\\Annotation\\Groups;\n// ...\n\n    #[Groups(['read:cassette'])]\n    private ?string $title = null;\n\n    #[Groups(['read:cassette'])]\n    private ?string $artist = null;\n\n    // ...\n\n    #[Groups(['read:cassette'])]\n    public function getFormattedDuration(): ?string\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n\nSo we did something odd here. We use a normalization-group defined in another API Resource and add it to the fields of the Song class. How would this ever be enough to get the behaviour that we want? The answer is magic! Or, serialization process, you can read more about that in API Platform's documention. This is the result:\n{\n  \"@context\": \"/api/contexts/Cassette\",\n  \"@id\": \"/api/cassettes/1\",\n  \"@type\": \"Cassette\",\n  \"title\": \"Mix Tape #1\",\n  \"sideA\": [\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"/api/songs/1\",\n      \"@type\": \"Song\",\n      \"title\": \"Never Gonna Give You Up\",\n      \"artist\": \"Rick Astley\",\n      \"formattedDuration\": \"3:34\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"/api/songs/2\",\n      \"@type\": \"Song\",\n      \"title\": \"If I Could Turn Back Time\",\n      \"artist\": \"Cher\",\n      \"formattedDuration\": \"3:59\"\n    },\n    // ...\n  ]\n  // ...\n}\n    \n\nAnd that is exactly what we were working towards! But we have only been scratching the surface of API Platform. There are many other topics to discover, such as:\n\nRESTful to GraphQL\nSecuring resources and operations\nThe Admin component\nFilters\n...and so much more!\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        What thou seest is but the shadow of the truth; the substance lies beneath, and thou must scratch the surface to reveal it.

Especially coming from an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) background. \nThere is so much to discover, because for many, it has flown under the radar. Just look at this chart!\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Look at it 👇\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    (ignore the cats)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\nWhile OOP is a popular thing, functional programming is growing in usage and being used in more contexts. While some \nlanguages allows for many approaches, Elixir locks you into its functional approach. We won't see any classes or loops,\nand we will soon find out why!\nToday we will explore some basic structures of the language by building a Fibonacci sequence\nfunction and a few tests for it. But before we do. A quick run-down of the Fibonacci Sequence. It follows a principle of \nevery number being the sum of the one just before and the one before that. To start off, it is stipulated that the first \nand second number are 1. This means that the third number is (1 + 1) = 2. The fourth will be (2 + 1) = 3. So the first \n7 numbers will be: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Let's purr some Elixir\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nWe create a new file called fibonacci.ex and define a module called Fibonacci:\ndefmodule Fibonacci do\n  def fib(n) when is_integer(n) and n &gt;= 0 do\n    fib_helper(n)\n  end\n\n  defp fib_helper(0), do: 0\n  defp fib_helper(1), do: 1\n  defp fib_helper(n), do: fib_helper(n - 1) + fib_helper(n - 2)\nend\n\nThe Module contains a function called fib with a guard \ndefined for it. This means that the function will only be run on arguments that are positive integers. Inside the \nfunction is another function-call. We make use of a function called fib_helper. This function has 3 definitions;\n\nOne is matching an argument that is 0 and returns 0.\nOne is matching an argument that is 1 and returns 1.\nOne is the Fibonacci sequence logic all wrapped up in recursion.\n\nWhen we pass it 3, we will match with the third fib_helper, it will first call, fib_helper(2) + fib_helper(1). \nThe first function call will again match the 3rd definition, so recursion, and the second function call will match the \n2nd definition. It will continue to do recursive calls until it does not call itself again. Such as is the case for the \ncalls that match either the first or the second definition of fib_helper.\n\nA fun detail about fib_helper is that it is private within the module. We can make functions private by using defp\ninstead of def.\nAn even more fun (as in fundamental) detail is how Elixir just returns values from our functions without us having to \ntell it to do so.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        If you don't like recursions, you gonna have a bad time\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nTo run our function we can run iex from the terminal where the files are located. This will open up the interactive \nElixir interface, or a REPL. From this we will \ncompile our file: c(\"fibonacci.ex\"). This will compile the module for us so we can call the fib function on it.\n \niex(1)&gt; c(\"fibonacci.ex\")\n[Fibonacci]\niex(2)&gt; Fibonacci.fib(5)\n5\niex(3)&gt; Fibonacci.fib(7)\n13\n\nHow do we know that our function really works correctly? Usually we would write tests. While many programming languages has excellent \nunit testing frameworks available to them as third party libraries, this is not necessary in Elixir. Because every \nline of code in Elixir is perfect! Well, mine are. As long as I keep the number of lines to 0. \nWell, if we do really want tests (and we do), we have a built-in testing-tool called \nExUnit. This means we can start writing tests just by starting a new file. \nLet's create fibonacci_test.exs. It will start the ExUnit testing application and make some assertions with the help \nof a module called ExUnit.Case. This will make it possible for us to assert that we get the correct Fibonacci value \nfor n-th position of the sequence.\nCode.require_file(\"./fibonacci.ex\")\n\nExUnit.start()\n\ndefmodule FibonacciTest do\n  use ExUnit.Case\n\n  test \"fibonacci of 0 is 0\" do\n    assert Fibonacci.fib(0) == 0\n  end\n\n  test \"fibonacci of 1 is 1\" do\n    assert Fibonacci.fib(1) == 1\n  end\n\n  test \"fibonacci of n is correct\" do\n    assert Fibonacci.fib(10) == 55\n    assert Fibonacci.fib(20) == 6765\n    assert Fibonacci.fib(30) == 832040\n  end\n  \n  test \"fibonacci of float is not allowed\" do\n    catch_error Fibonacci.fib(1.2)\n  end\n\n  test \"fibonacci of negative is not allowed\" do\n    catch_error Fibonacci.fib(-2)\n  end\nend\n\n\nFor the test file to be aware of the module we want to test, we first have to import the file. Next, we are starting the \ntesting application in the file for it to be able to run the module's test-cases. We define a few test-cases, just to \nsee that we have defined the constraints for the sequence correctly, and that a few n-th positions returns correct values. \nTo run the test-file, we will run this in the terminal (not in iex):\nelixir fibonacci_test.exs\nGiving us the following output:\n.....\nFinished in 0.04 seconds (0.04s on load, 0.00s async, 0.00s sync)\n5 tests, 0 failures\n\nTo dip a bit further into the Elixir pond, let's create a function to return a list of all the values in a sequence up \nto a n-th number, but limit to maximum of 30 numbers. The test for it would look like this: \n  test \"fibonacci sequence up to 8\" do\n    assert Fibonacci.seq(8) == [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]\n  end\n\n\nAs a matter of the modern take on Fibonacci sequence, the 0-th number is included. \n\nWe create the seq function in fibonacci.ex. It will make use of our already defined fib function. We will see some \nesoteric language, but we will be able to discern the meaning.\n  def seq(n) when is_integer(n) and n &gt;= 0 and n &lt;= 30 do\n    Enum.map(0..n, &amp;fib/1)\n  end\n\nWe define the function seq to take an integer between (and including) 0 and 30. We then define a list of \nnumbers from 0 up to the supplied number (0..n) and have a map-function (from Enum) to have a function \napplied for each number on the sequence (&amp;fib/1). Let's unpack that series of characters a bit!\n\n&amp; in this context means (anonymous) function. \nfib/1 is the function with an \narity of 1 - which means the \nfunction fib that takes 1 argument (no more or less)\nWhich means that &amp;fib/1 is shorthand for writing fn (n) -&gt; fib n end.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Is that all it takes?\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nWhile this looks neat, let's run the tests:\nelixir fibonacci_test.exs                                                                                                                                                                         \n......\nFinished in 0.04 seconds (0.03s on load, 0.00s async, 0.01s sync)\n6 tests, 0 failures\n\n...and all was good!\nLet us now create a print function to print out each value in a sequence. We will see one convoluted way of doing it\nand refine it later. What we will see is a pipe operator \nfor passing the result of one function in to the other, pattern matching \nto unpack a list, the unless-condition \nto check if a pattern match is not true and a perfectly good for-loop nowhere to be seen and in its place, recursion!\nIn the module Fibonacci (fibonacci.ex-file) we add these functions:\n  def print_seq(n) do\n    seq(n) |&gt; print_seq_helper\n  end\n\n  defp print_seq_helper([head|tail]) do\n    IO.puts(head)\n\n    unless [] == tail do\n      print_seq_helper(tail)\n    end\n\n    :ok\n  end\n\nThe first function is the public facing function print_seq. This will take an argument and pass it to the seq function. \nWith n = 3 the seq function would return a list with the value [0, 1, 2, 3]. We pipe |&gt;  this to the next \nfunction; print_seq_helper. Something incredible happens when we do that. We will pattern match  the incoming \nargument and have the first element of the list signed onto head and keep the rest of the elements as a list in tail.\nWhen we call IO.puts(head) it will print out the value that is currently in head. Next we check that the tail is \nnot an empty list and again call print_seq_helper and let it take the next element in the list to the head. And so \non it goes until the list is empty and a \"simple\" :ok is returned.\nThe :ok is called an \natom. It is a constant that has the same value as it is \nnamed. The name can be most anything we want. We could return :cat_in_a_hat if we wanted to! \nWhen we return to iex we can compile the latest changes and see what our output will be:\niex(1)&gt; c(\"fibonacci.ex\")\nwarning: redefining module Fibonacci (current version defined in memory)\n  fibonacci.ex:1\n\n[Fibonacci]\niex(2)&gt; Fibonacci.print_seq(8)\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n13\n21\n:cat_in_a_hat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nGreat! It's just the way we wanted it. And we got a cat in a hat as well. But why no for loop to go through the list? \nThe thing about Elixir is immutability. It just has a complete loathing of variables that are variable... anything \nthat changes what they once have said they are. It rather have you trash your variable and replace it with a new than \nyou were to change the value of the variable. A for-loop or a for-each-loop would have a variable hold the current \niteration or element without replacing the variable. So a loop like this would constantly be changing the value of the \nloop variable. \nWith all of that now out of the way, how could we rewrite the print-function to be a bit more neat? How about this?!\n  def print_seq(n) do\n    Enum.each(seq(n), &amp;IO.puts/1)\n  end\n\nNo need for a helper-function and everything done in a single row. It looks very nice, and  it has a pretty good \nreplacement for a for-each loop. The sad news though: we lost the :cat_in_a_hat, but it's :ok!\niex(3)&gt; r(Fibonacci)\nwarning: redefining module Fibonacci (current version defined in memory)\n  fibonacci.ex:1\n\n{:reloaded, [Fibonacci]}\niex(4)&gt; Fibonacci.print_seq(8)\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n13\n21\n:ok\n\nIn this article, we have made some pretty astounding discoveries!\n\nThere are other programming languages out there beside [insert your favourite language here]\nFunctional programming is do-able\nFor-loops are mutable, and mutations are loathed\nRecursions everywhere!\nPattern matching can be used for unpacking values of a list\nFunctions can have guards\nArity is apparently a thing\nPipe operators gives this to that\nfn needs shortening to &amp;\nTests are right there to be written, if you don't write perfect code from line 0\nThe author of this article has a weird fixation to include cats in this article.

It’s perfect for building highly scalable and fault-tolerant applications. In this article, we’ll explore Phoenix by building a simple RESTful API with it. But not just any API - we’ll build a dad-joke machine! We’ll show you how to generate schemas and controllers in one fell swoop, add new fields to an API endpoint, and rediscover the ancient wisdom of dad-jokers before us.\n\n\n    Reading time: 8 minutes\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        What do you get when you cross a phoenix and a unicorn? A magical mystery tour!\n\n    \n    \nProject Setup\nTo get smooth sailing with this discovery we will be using Elixir 1.14 and Phoenix v1.7. If you don’t have it setup already you can follow the instructions over at hexdocs.\nTo create a new Phoenix project suitable for an API we will run the following command:\nmix phx.new jokes_api --no-html --no-assets\nHere's the anatomy of the command:\n\nmixThe Elixir build tool and dependency chief-coordinator\nphx.newA Mix build task that creates a Phoenix project\njokes_apiOur project’s name\n--no-htmlinstructs phx.new to not create any templates for us\n--no-assets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructs phx.new to not create any static assets (such as CSS- and JS-files)\n\nAfter creating the project structure with all the necessary dependencies we can take our next step. As we will be doing some reading and writing to a database, let's set it up. We want a PostgreSQL database for the project, so let's add a docker-container for it. We move in to the project directory and create a docker-compose.yaml:\nversion: \"3.7\"\nservices:\n db:\n   image: postgres\n   environment:\n     POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n     POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\n   ports:\n     - \"5432:5432\"\n   volumes:\n     - pg_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n\n\nvolumes:\n pg_db:\n\nWe specify that we want the database to have a user called postgres and the password postgres. We need to update (or confirm) that our Phoenix project has these credentails as well. We find the configuration for this in config/dev.exs\nconfig :jokes_api, JokesApi.Repo,\n username: \"postgres\",\n password: \"postgres\",\n hostname: \"localhost\",\n database: \"jokes_api_dev\",\n stacktrace: true,\n show_sensitive_data_on_connection_error: true,\n pool_size: 10\n\nIt’s looking good. It has the correct credentials. It's also referenceing a database, jokes_api_dev, which we will create now. From the command line:\nmix ecto.create\n\necto is the database schema manager that Phoenix relies on. It creates our databases and database schemas. ecto.create is the mix build task which will create the database defined in our configuration. ecto can be used with other types of databases as well, such as MySQL and SQLite3.\n\nThe anatomy of a joke\nFor our dad-joke machine to get going, we will want a schema for it. Let's imagine that a joke has text-content, and that we will want to be able to rate it. Either we like it, or we dislike it. Our model should be something like this: \nfieldtype\ntexttext\nlikesinteger\ndislikes&nbsp;&nbsp;integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What do you call a fish with no eye?\n    Fsh\n    \n        \n    \n\nWe will now create both the database schema and the API schema for our Joke model. It's all done with a single command from the terminal:\nmix phx.gen.json Jokes Joke jokes text:text likes:integer dislikes:integer\nThere are a lot of jokes going around, so what do they mean in this context? Again we are using mix, our Elixir build tool. We are employing Phoenix's phx.gen.json for this task. It will create a controller, JSON API-schema, and via ecto it will also create a migration file to update the database schema. Jokes Joke will define the namespace for our model module. The name for its database table is jokes. And text:text likes:integer dislikes:integer will define the model's fields and their types.\nWith a migration file we can update the database. We do that with:\nmix ecto.migrate\nWe have now defined how a Joke should look like in the API as well as prepared our database to handle it. We are ready for our next steps.\nA server walks into a bar\nWe may want to view our small project to get a feel for how far we have come. We will need a server to show our project. Thankfully, Phoenix has a great server that can be used in development as well as in production. We run it with this command:\nmix phx.server\nThis will per default serve our application to localhost:4000. As we do not have any HTML templates or assets, we will see Phoenix's development debug view. Which will serve us great here. This is our view:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nFrom what we see here, it does not look like we have any new API-endpoints. But we can easily expose the JSON-schema defined for us. We have to map them to a new route, is all.\nIn lib/jokes_api_web/router.ex we will expose the endpoints we like on a module called JokeController (which were generated by our earlier mix task):\n scope \"/api\", JokesApiWeb do\n   pipe_through :api\n\n   resources \"/jokes\", JokeController, except: [:new, :edit, :delete]\n end\n\n\nSaving the file and reviewing what we have shows us a bunch of new routes:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nWe can try to create a new file now. I’m using Postman, but you might as well use CRUD.\nWhat do you feel about this:\n“There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don’t”\nLet’s try adding it to the database. We make a POST request to http://localhost:4000/api/jokes with the following payload:\n{\n   \"joke\": {\n       \"text\": \"There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don’t.\"\n   }\n}\n\nWhat may the result be? Here’s what:\n{\n   \"errors\": {\n       \"dislikes\": [\n           \"can't be blank\"\n       ],\n       \"likes\": [\n           \"can't be blank\"\n       ]\n   }\n}\n\nOur model requires dislikes and likes to be set. But we don’t want that. We want these to start off with 0 and only be modified incrementally. A way to do that is to define a default value for the model. \nlib/jokes_api/jokes/joke.ex:\n schema \"jokes\" do\n   field :dislikes, :integer, default: 0\n   field :likes, :integer, default: 0\n   field :text, :string\n\n\n   timestamps()\n end\n\n\nWhen we retry our POST-request this will be the result:\n{\n   \"data\": {\n       \"dislikes\": 0,\n       \"id\": 1,\n       \"likes\": 0,\n       \"text\": \"There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don’t.\"\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Success!\n\n    \n    \nMore routes and fields!\nLet’s add two new endpoints. One for disliking a joke, and another for liking it!\nIn the controller lib/jokes_api_web/controllers/joke_controller.ex:\n\n def like(conn, %{\"id\" =&gt; id}) do\n   joke = Jokes.get_joke!(id)\n\n   likes = joke.likes + 1\n   joke_params = %{likes: likes}\n\n   with {:ok, %Joke{} = joke} &lt;- Jokes.update_joke(joke, joke_params) do\n     render(conn, :show, joke: joke)\n   end\n end\n\n def dislike(conn, %{\"id\" =&gt; id}) do\n   joke = Jokes.get_joke!(id)\n\n   dislikes = joke.dislikes + 1\n   joke_params = %{dislikes: dislikes}\n\n   with {:ok, %Joke{} = joke} &lt;- Jokes.update_joke(joke, joke_params) do\n     render(conn, :show, joke: joke)\n   end\n end\n\nWith these new endpoints we can now increment the dislikes or the likes to our hearts content.\nAnd for a final touch. Let’s add a field to the JSON-response that shows the score, that is the difference between likes and dislikes. The API schema is defined in lib/jokes_api_web/controllers/joke_json.ex. Let’s update it:\n defp data(%Joke{} = joke) do\n   %{\n     id: joke.id,\n     text: joke.text,\n     likes: joke.likes,\n     dislikes: joke.dislikes,\n     score: joke.likes - joke.dislikes\n   }\n end\n\nWe can like any joke we like by making a PATCH request to http://localhost:4000/api/jokes/1/like. This will increment the joke's likes. Similarly, we can dislike a joke by substituting like for dislike in the URL. After a couple of votes we can see its score at 4:\n{\n   \"data\": {\n       \"dislikes\": 1,\n       \"id\": 1,\n       \"likes\": 5,\n       \"score\": 4,\n       \"text\": \"There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don’t.\"\n   }\n}\n\nWe have successfully created a simple API with potential of becoming a fearsome dad-jokes machine. A couple of commands and some modifications to the code has gotten us here. In my opinion a pretty swell experience. With a tool like Phoenix it's easy to feel top of your game.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    I'm outstanding in my field!\n    \n        \n    \n","id":"https://abjork.land/articles/exploration/discovering-phoenix/","title":"Discovering Phoenix"},"https://abjork.land/articles/exploration/php-evolution/":{"body":"\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Evolution of PHP\n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n    \n        \n        PHP\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there have been articles before foretelling about both the death and the rebirth of PHP, this time we will simply look at how PHP has evolved over the years and what has been the driving force behind it.\nThe beginning\nLet's take a journey back to the early days of the web, when Rasmus Lerdorf created PHP in 1994. It all started with a simple idea - to track visitors to his online resume. Rasmus wrote a collection of C programs to do just that, and thus PHP was born.[1]\nSo it started from a very personal need, but Rasmus kept developing and rewriting his PHP scripts. He strived to keep it similar to C, which meant that developers familiar with C and PERL could pick it up with \"ease\". \nIn 1997, two Israeli developers were using PHP and found that it had some limitations. They decided to approach the creator of PHP, Rasmus Lerdorf, with suggestions for improvement. This was a pivotal moment in the evolution of PHP, as it led to a complete rewrite of the parser in C and the release of PHP 3.\nWith PHP 3, the language gained support for multiple database interfaces and Object Oriented Programming. This was a huge leap forward for PHP, and its popularity grew rapidly. People from all around the world started contributing to the development of PHP, adding new features and improving its underlying architecture.\nToday, PHP is a full-fledged programming language that powers a large part of the web. It has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a tool to track visitors to a resume. And the discussions and contributions that have shaped the language are a testament to the power of collaboration and community in software development.\nThe collaborative nature of PHP\nPHP is a language that has been shaped by its community. While it started out as one man's effort, it has grown into a language that is developed by the community, for the community. The discussions leading up to new features and improvements to the language are open for public view in the Internals mailing list..\nThe purpose of these discussions is to inform the community and language feature voters on what features to implement, and how to do that. This is where the community comes together to make suggestions for improvement and request feedback on their ideas.\nThe voters in the PHP community are responsible for taking a stand on the features that are being discussed. They vote on the features, and if a feature gets enough votes, it will be implemented. This democratic process ensures that the community has a say in the direction of the language, and that the language continues to evolve to meet the needs of its users.\nSo if you're a PHP developer, you have the power to shape the future of the language. You can make suggestions for improvement, provide feedback on other people's ideas, and (if you get recognized as a main contributor) vote on the features that you think are important. By participating in the PHP community, you can help to ensure that PHP continues to be a language that is developed by the community, for the community.\nLet's look at a popular feature which was finally introduced in PHP 7; Return type declaration. This feature meant that a function now could declare which type it would return.\nfunction sum(int $a, int $b): int {\n    return $a + $b;\n}\n\nThe return types-RFC shows it being introduced in 2014, but a pre-cursor to it was introduced in 2011 and withdrawn. The mailing list means that questions and concerns can be raised and discussed before the vote, and thus increasing the likelihood of a successful vote. For example, here's a concern that was raised what return types would mean for using of types in closures:\nOn Fri, Jan 16, 2015 at 4:53 PM, Simon J Welsh &lt;simon@welsh.co.nz&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; The tests have it after the use():\n&gt; https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/997/files#diff-e306c6e99612ba59b00a4fe435b287e5R9\n&gt;\n&gt; This was discussed in depth a couple of times in the related threads.\n&gt;\n\nThank you for the information. It should be in the RFC. IMHO.\nI feels natural to have type spec after function parameter definition\nrather than\nafter \"use\".\n\nAnyway, I looked HACK/HHVM manual\nhttp://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/index.php\nand couldn't find the syntax.\n\nIf it's the same, then it should be OK.\nI'm just making sure before voting.\n\nRe: [RFC][Vote] Return Types, 16th January 2015\nThe final vote ended up with 47 in favor and 3 against. And the feature was introduced in PHP 7.0. \n\nWho can vote?\nTwo type of voters exists: Members of the core team, and members of the community deemed to be major contributors by the core team. \n\nThe evolution of PHP code\nHere's a simple object-oriented example to showcase how PHP has evolved, by providing an example of a code in PHP 4, and then how it would look like in PHP 5, 7, and 8:\n// PHP 4\nclass User {\n    var $name;\n    var $age;\n    var $email;\n\n    function User($name, $age, $email) {\n        $this-&gt;name = $name;\n        $this-&gt;age = $age;\n        $this-&gt;email = $email;\n    }\n\n    function getName() {\n        return $this-&gt;name;\n    }\n\n    function getAge() {\n        return $this-&gt;age;\n    }\n\n    function getEmail() {\n        return $this-&gt;email;\n    }\n}\n\n$user = new User('Anders', 37, 'anders.bjorkland@umain.com');\necho 'Hello ' . $user-&gt;getName();\n\n// PHP 5.3\nnamespace App\\Entity; // namespaces are introduced\n\nclass User {\n    // introduced accessor keywords\n    private $name;\n    private $age;\n    private $email;\n\n    public function __construct($name, $age, $email) {\n        $this-&gt;name = $name;\n        $this-&gt;age = $age;\n        $this-&gt;email = $email;\n    }\n\n    public function getName() {\n        return $this-&gt;name;\n    }\n\n    public function getAge() {\n        return $this-&gt;age;\n    }\n\n    public function getEmail() {\n        return $this-&gt;email;\n    }\n}\n\n// PHP 7.4\nclass User {\n    // introduced types for properties (7.4)\n    private string $name;\n    private string $age;\n    private string $email;\n\n    // introduced types for parameters (7.0)\n    public function __construct(string $name, int $age, string $email) {\n        $this-&gt;name = $name;\n        $this-&gt;age = $age;\n        $this-&gt;email = $email;\n    }\n\n    // ...and for return types (7.0)\n    public function getName(): string \n    {\n        return $this-&gt;name;\n    }\n\n    public function getAge(): int \n    {\n        return $this-&gt;age;\n    }\n\n    public function getEmail(): string \n    {\n        return $this-&gt;email;\n    }\n}\n\n// PHP 8\nclass User {\n    // introduced property promotion and named arguments\n    public function __construct(\n        private string $name,\n        private int $age,\n        private ?string $email = null\n    ) {}\n\n    // introduced union types (8.0)\n    public function getName(): string|int \n    {\n        return $this-&gt;name;\n    }\n\n    public function getAge(): int \n    {\n        return $this-&gt;age;\n    }\n\n    public function getEmail(): ?string \n    {\n        return $this-&gt;email;\n    }\n}\n\n$user = new User(\n    name: 'Anders', \n    age: 37\n);\n\necho 'Hello ' . $user-&gt;getName();\n\nWhat we can see is an improved support for types, and a more concise syntax. In addition to this, there have been improvements with the underlying code parser, which has led to better performance. In a benchmark test (a script is executed 100 times), we can see its execution time going from 237 seconds (PHP 4.0.6) to 17 seconds (PHP 8.0). Which in most worlds would be considered a significant improvement. But then again, this has been a development over 20+ years.\nBonus-features\nAttributes\nPHP 8.0 also introduced attributes, which is a way to add metadata to classes, methods, and functions. Its predecessor were annotations via PHPDocs, but this is now the native way to do that.\nclass User {\n    #[ORM\\Column(type: \"string\", length: 255)]\n    private string $name;\n\n    #[ORM\\Column(type: \"integer\")]\n    private int $age;\n\n    #[ORM\\Column(type: \"string\", length: 255)]\n    private string $email;\n\n    public function __construct(\n        private string $name,\n        private int $age,\n        private string $email\n    ) {}\n}\n\nArrow-functions\nPHP 7.4 introduced arrow-functions, which is a more concise way to write anonymous functions. \n// PHP 7.4\n$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n$multiplier = 2;\n\n$multiplied = array_map(fn($x) use ($multiplier) =&gt; $x * $multiplier, $numbers);\n\nvar_export($multiplied);\n\n/* Output:\narray (\n  0 =&gt; 2,\n  1 =&gt; 4,\n  2 =&gt; 6,\n  3 =&gt; 8,\n  4 =&gt; 10,\n)\n */\n\nNull coalescing assignment operator\nPHP 7.4 has also introduced the null coalescing assignment operator, which is a more concise way to assign a value to a variable if it's not already set.\n$foo = $bar ?? 'default';\n\nNullsafe operator\nPHP 8.0 introduced the nullsafe operator, which is a more concise way to check if a property or method exists on a variable.\n$foo = $bar?-&gt;baz();\n\nMatch expression\nPHP 8.0 also introduced the match expression, which (kind-of) is a more concise way to write switch statements.\n$bar = 5;\n\n$foo = match ($bar) {\n    1 =&gt; 'one',\n    2 =&gt; 'two',\n    3 =&gt; 'three',\n    4, 5, 6 =&gt; 'four to six',\n    default =&gt; 'unknown'\n};\n\necho $foo; // 'four to six'\n\n\n// alternate match:\n$foo = match (true) {\n    $bar &lt; 4 =&gt; 'less than four',\n    $bar &gt;= 4 =&gt; '4 or greater',\n    default =&gt; 'unknown'\n};\n\necho $foo; // '4 or greater'\n\n\nUnion types\nPHP 8.0 introduced union types, which is a way to declare that a variable can be of multiple types.\nclass User {\n    public function __construct(\n        private string|int $name,\n        private int $age,\n        private ?string $email = null\n    ) {}\n\n    public function getName(): string|int \n    {\n        return $this-&gt;name;\n    }\n\n    public function getAge(): int \n    {\n        return $this-&gt;age;\n    }\n\n    public function getEmail(): ?string \n    {\n        return $this-&gt;email;\n    }\n}\n\n$user = new User(24, 37);\n\necho $user-&gt;getName(); // 24\n\nENUMERATIONS!!!\nPHP 8.1 finally introduced enumerations, which is a way to declare a set of named constants.\nenum Fruit {\n    case Apple;\n    case Banana;\n    case Orange;\n}\n\nfunction eatFruit(Fruit $fruit) {\n    switch ($fruit) {\n        case Fruit::Apple:\n            echo 'Yummy';\n            break;\n        case Fruit::Banana:\n            echo 'B &amp; NaN';\n            break;\n        case Fruit::Orange:\n            echo 'Red-yello treat';\n            break;\n    }\n}\n\nFibers\nPHP 8.1 also introduced fibers, which is a way to create interruptible functions, enhancing PHP's ability to handle asynchronous tasks. This has come to be used to great effect in asynchronous frameworks such as ReactPHP.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, PHP has come a long way since its early days as a simple tool for tracking visitors to a resume. Over the years, the language has evolved to become a powerful and feature-rich language that is used by millions of developers around the world.\nOne of the key factors in PHP's success has been its ability to evolve with the needs of its users. From the addition of object-oriented programming in PHP 4 to attributes and fibers in PHP 8, PHP has continued to add new features and improve its syntax to make it more powerful and flexible.\nAs PHP continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see what new features and improvements are added to the language. But one thing is certain - PHP will continue to be a language that is developed by the community, for the community. And that is what makes it such a powerful and enduring language.\n1.

And with all the rage that is “AI” and machine learning (ML), I thought now would be a good time. I did an initial venture into ML but quickly realized that I do not know a knob from a steering wheel. That was when the YouTube Algo-monster figured I should look at a clip by AssemblyAI: “How I would learn Machine Learning (if I could start over)”. And it was just what I needed to hear. So here I am, learning ML by first investing time in… MATH! \nHere are 3 points of why some mathematical skills would be an advantage to have going into ML:\nCalculus is used for optimization algorithms - a group of algorithms that try to find the best solution to a problem.\nLinear Algebra deals with linear equations and matrices. In ML this is used in data preprocessing, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. \nProbability and Statistics are used for modeling uncertainty and making predictions. \nThis will be a series of articles where I delve into some of these Mathematical concepts. Starting with Calculus’s core concept:  Limits!\nLimits\nThe essence to defining continuity, derivatives, and integrals comes down to limits. We will definitely see limits when we want to look at derivatives - or the rate of a change at a specific point. But even before we step into that realm, consider the function \nf(x)=(x-4)/(x-4):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nFrom a cursory glance, we see that the function will equal to 1, for whatever value of x. Well, almost. When we have x=4 we will have a situation. \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nThis would mean that we would have 0 divided by 0 which is an undefined concept. We can’t divide anything with 0. But as x approaches 4 we see that we have 1. With x really really close to that undefined, such as 3.9999, we see that we still have y = 1. On the other side we see that y(4.0001) = 1. While x = 4 is undefined for our function, we can take the limit of f at x = 4 and find that it is 1. We will have this expression:\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nIt’s like magic! But keep in mind, this does not say that y(4) = 1, rather it is saying that the equation will behave in such a way that y will be 1 as we are moving very very close to x = 4.\nBut this magic has its limits! If we find that as we increase x and moving closer to a point has one value, and decrease x to move closer to that same point from the other directions is moving us closer to a different value, then we have a situation where we can’t apply limits to find the value as we are moving closer to x. Consider the function f(x)=x/(x - 2):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nAs we increase x from 1 and get closer to 2, we see that y will decrease dramatically. From the opposite side we see that when we decrease x from 3 and get closer to 2, we see that y will increase dramatically. In this example we do not have a limit for when x gets closer to 2, the limit does not exist. This actually showcases 2 ways that a limit does not exist:\n\nAs we get closer to 2, the y-value moves in a different direction depending on the direction from which we approach 2.\nAs we get closer to 2, the y-value is unbounded. \n\nOne-sided limits\nWe have described how a limit does not exist when the value of y approaches different values depending on the direction we are approaching a value of x from. We can however give ourselves more leeway by describing a one-sided limit. Take this example, a function would have the limit of x approach 4 when we move closer to x = 2. On the other side the x might approach -2. This give us the following expressions:\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\nBut as we have described earlier, the two-sided limit does not exist when we approach different values from the two directions.\nThe limit when the function’s value do exist\nThe function f(x)=x^2+3 is defined when x=2. This does not stop us from looking for its limit. In this case, we arrive at the limit approaching the same value as the defined value for f(x). But this does not mean that the limit necessarily will approach the defined value.\nConclusion confusion\nSo there you have it! We’ve seen how limits can help us approach undefined positions in a function using different graphs. This is a really important concept in calculus and mathematical analysis, and it’s also relevant to machine learning. By understanding the basics of limits, we can better understand the math behind machine learning and its optimization algorithms.
