Are you missing a stock limit in your Sylius storefront? Say no more! In this article, weâ€™ll show you how to add a Stock Limit to your Sylius Storefront with ease. With Syliusâ€™ flexibility and malleability, you can enhance your inventory in ways you never thought possible. And who knows? You might even have some fun along the way ðŸ˜‰.  
  
## How it starts
The 'Track' button is Syliusâ€™ trusty sidekick to keep your inventory in check with. With it you can ensure that you only sell what is in your stock.  

So what is it? Itâ€™s Syliusâ€™ inventory feature! With this feature, you can set how many items are available for each product variant you have. By setting 'Track' on it, Sylius will add a validation check when a customer wants to add that item to their cart. This way, you will never sell more than what you have. But is it enough?
  
Sometimes, you just need a little extra something to feel like a true eCommerce mogul. Perhaps you don't want to sell all the items in stock, but keep some in store for later. Such a neat buffer-feature would be truly great to have. As this does not come out-of-the box for us, we will make it ourselves!

To reach our aim to feel like that eCommerce mogul we all strive to be, here is what we will do:
* Create a `StockLimitInterface`
* Implement the interface on `ProductVariant` and add a `stockLimit` field
* Update the UI for setting the limit
* Create an `AvailabilityCheckerDecorator`

{% quoter() %}I shop therefore I am. Itâ€™s like Descartes but with more bags.{% end %}

### Our aim 
By the end of this article, youâ€™ll be able to take advantage of our new, fresh-from-the-press, feature: individual stock limits for each product variant. With this feature, youâ€™ll be able to set limits on how many of each product variant can be added to a cart. Youâ€™ll also be able to see when a product variant has less than the limit in stock. This new feature is perfect for businesses that want to manage their inventory more effectively and avoid overselling products. So letâ€™s dive in and see how it all works!
