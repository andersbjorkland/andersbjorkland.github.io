## It begins
In the vast expanse of the programming universe, a new dimension has gotten more and more attention. It's a dimension of endless possibilities. A dimension of infinite knowledge. A dimension of... **Machine Learning**. The first and foremost way to train and interact with Machine learning models is Python. But just like the Universe, the ways are ever expanding. With the help of Kotlin, we can continue to explore and harness the power of this dimension.

But how do we explore this dimension? Well, we lean on a tool familiar to many Python developers and data scientists. [**Jupyter**](https://jupyter.org/install). Jupyter notebooks are a great way to explore and experiment with data. It's a great way to visualize and interact with data. And it's a great way to share your findings with others. And by the friendly help of JetBrains, we can use a [Kotlin Kernel](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter) to do all of this with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

As we explore this dimension, we will journey through a few different models (some of which we have seen in a previous article). We will see how KotlinDL and ONNX are a powerful combination to interact with models and bring us new insights.
