) }}

A Docker Image built with ease of use in mind, to easily set up a showcase should the need arise.
The image uses supervisord to run the following services:
* PHP-FPM
* Nginx
* MariaDB

The image showcases the Sylius example shop and allows for loading its fixtures for example content. 
Check the image out on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/abjorkland/sylius-showcase)
