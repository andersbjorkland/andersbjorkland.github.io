<p>AI is all the rage right now. While it's not the first time in history that we believe we are on the cusp of a great leap in AI advancement only to have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">&quot;AI winter&quot;</a> fall upon the field. This time it feels different, and rather than waning investments in the field, we see many diverse organizations (and individuals) running towards ChatGPT and other ML models to enhance their operations. We can see their uses from Search Algorithms to medical diagnoses. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/12/1072950/open-source-ai-google-openai-eleuther-meta/">While some argue</a> that privately owned and privately licensed models will always have the upper hand on open source models, the <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither">opposite sentiment can also be found</a>. No matter which side of the argument you fall, it can't be denied that open source models can provide great value for whomever chooses to use them.</p>
<p>In this article we will dive into a few of these models and see what they are capable of. We will give an overview of different areas they can be used in and provide links for those who want to read their respective research paper. We will see models for sentiment analysis, image recognition, voice recognition, named entity recognition, text generation, and text-to-image generation. And as a surprise (<strong>SPOILER ALERT!</strong>), we may recognize that some of these models have multiple areas of applications.</p>
<h2 id="1-sentiment-analysis">1. Sentiment analysis</h2>
<p>Natural language processing (NLP) is a field where we can harness the power of computers to make sense of human language. That's where we see models such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/bert-101">BERT</a> or <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart">BART</a> being used for different tasks. When it comes to sentiment analysis, we often see a BERT-type model being used. One example is XLM-RoBERTa, a multilingual model. In this example we can see it being used for classifying a text based on 3 different categories, and the probability that the text expresses a particular sentiment: </p>

<h2 id="2-image-classification-with-resnet">2. Image classification with ResNet</h2>
<p>From Microsoft Research comes this open source Image Recognition model, Residual Network (ResNet). In its basic form, it will try to classify a single dominant object in a picture. Derived models comes with more features, such as detecting multiple objects in a picture.</p>
<p>In this example, the <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-101">facebook/detr-rednet-101</a> model detects 3 objects, but gives two classifications for the car, either a truck or a car. It also successfully detects the two persons.</p>

<p>The ResNet model was introduced by Microsoft Research in December 2015 with the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition</a>. The detection transformer (DETR) variant from Facebook AI was introduced in May 2020 with the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872">End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="3-voice-recognition-with-whisper">3. Voice recognition with Whisper</h2>
<p>Automatic speech recognition is a task where a model is used to enable a program to process human speech into text. So in essence, it is a speech-to-text model. Whisper is a popular model from OpenAI. It can be used for transcribing recordings and real-time speech recognition tasks.</p>
<p>In this example I'm posing the model with an important query:
{{ imager_standard(
asset='articles/elixir/opensource-models/whisper-01.png', 
alt='Speech is transcribed to &quot;Just because you can Fourier transform a cat doesn't mean you should, but really you really should.&quot;.', 
class='center'
) }}</p>
<p>Whisper was introduced in December 2022 in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356">Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision</a>.</p>
<h2 id="4-named-entity-recognition">4. Named Entity Recognition</h2>
<p>A useful task in processing language is extracting tokens from text, such as recognizing if a location or a person is mentioned, or perhaps some grammatical features. BERT is often used for this as this model is good at taking the context into account, and if multilingual support is needed, XLM-RoBERTa can be applied. </p>
<p>In this example we are using a RoBERTa model trained on English to detect persons, location, and organization:</p>

<h2 id="5-text-generation">5. Text Generation</h2>
<p>This is one of the tasks that has lead to some AI-craze of late, especially when a Text Generation model is being used as a chat partner. <strong>ChatGPT</strong> based on GPT versions 3+ and <strong>BARD</strong> based on PaLM, are two examples of this. But neither is currently on an open source license. <strong>HuggingChat</strong> is closer to open-source, but it is based on a LLaMA derivate and so it has a different kind of license attached (not any of the common open-source licenses like Appache 2.0 or MIT). There are more specialized conversational models, like <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill">facebook/blenderbot</a>.</p>
<p>But if we want to take a look at a simpler text-generation task, without the conversational part, we can find many available models. <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill">DistilGPT2</a> is a smaller variant of GPT version 2, an open-source model. Here it is in action, where we can see it generate one word at a time.</p>

<h2 id="bubbler-text-summarization">Bubbler: Text Summarization</h2>
<p>There are models that have trained on texts that have been distorted and the models then should be able to recreate the text in its original form. This way of training has led to models like BART being well suited to tasks where they should distil a body of text in to smaller segments in a way where it does not lose too much information. </p>
<p>An example of this is <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn">facebook/bart-large-cnn</a>, which is a BART model that has been trained on CNN Daily Mail. When summarizing the very first paragraph of Charles Dickens's &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; we get:</p>

<h2 id="bubbler-q-a">Bubbler: Q/A</h2>
<p>Question and Answer is a task well suited for models that take context of words into account. The BERT-family of models are often used here. In general, there are in general three types of Q/A models: extractive, open-generative, and closed-generative. Extractive models can <em>extract</em> the answer from the provided context (be it text, table, or markup). Open-generative models glean the answer from the context and generate free text as an answer. Closed-generative models do not need a provided context. They are trained within a domain and the answer is purely generated by the model.</p>

<h3 id="open-generative-model-example">Open-generative model example</h3>
<p>An open-generative model will rely on contexts to freely generate answers. The context is sometimes a database of documents, as is the case for <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/deepset/wikipedia-assistant">Wikipedia Assistant</a>. It provides a Long-Form Question Answering that can encode the question to fetch relevant documents (context) and a BART model that can parse the provided context to generate an answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:<br />
What is an advantage of using quantum machine learning?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><br />
<code>Quantum machine learning is an area of research that is still very much in its infancy. The most common use of the term refers to machine learning algorithms for the analysis of classical data executed on a quantum computer, i.e. &quot;quantum-enhanced machine learning&quot; (QML). The main advantage of QML is that it can be applied to a large number of data sets at once. For example, if you have a large set of data, and you want to learn how to classify it, you can use QML to do this. However, the problem is that QML can't be used to solve all of the data sets in the same way that a classical machine learning algorithm can. For instance, you might want to use a QML algorithm to solve the problem of how to categorize a large collection of images, but you can't use a classical algorithm to do the same thing with the same number of images. So, you need to use quantum machine learning to solve this problem. Another advantage is that you don't have to worry about the fact that the data set you're trying to classify is quantum.</code></p>

A sufficiently advanced quantum computer would break current encryption methods by factorizing large numbers several orders of magnitude faster than any existing classical computer. Any computable problem may be expressed as a general quantum search algorithm although classical computers may have an advantage over quantum search when using more efficient tailored classical algorithms. The issue with quantum computers is that a measurement must be made to determine if the problem is solved which collapses the superposition. Vedral points out that unintentional interaction with the environment can be mitigated with redundancy, and this would be necessary if we were to scale up current quantum computers to achieve greater utility, i.e. to utilize 10 qubits have a 100 atom quantum system so that if one atom decoheres a consensus will still be held by the other 9 for the state of the same qubit.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">\n</span><span>",

Furthermore, quantum algorithms can be used to analyze quantum states instead of classical data.

<p>We have seen many different ML tasks - and that different models are seemed to be used for different tasks. BERT and BART are models that looks to be used in similar contexts, but whereas BERT seem better suited for taking apart a sentence, BART seem better at distilling meaning from a larger body of text into a summarized body, and for text generation. We have also seen models for making sense of images (ResNet), voice recognition (Whisper), and image generation (Stable Diffusion). </p>
<p>We have given a quick overview over some of the most exciting models and how they are used. But there are a tonne more out there to discover. And to use.
